# Quality Gates

This is the consumer-facing reference for the quality gates the framework
runs against your repo: the lint baseline ratchet, the maintainability
ratchet, the CRAP per-method gate, the **absolute quality floors**
(90/85/90 coverage, MI ≥ 70, CRAP ≤ 20), the anti-thrashing protocol,
and the concurrent close-safety retry that protects Story-branch pushes
when multiple Stories close in quick succession.

The floor + ratchet duo is intentional: the ratchet protects against
regressions on touched files; the floor enforces an absolute threshold
on every in-scope file regardless of diff scope. See
[§ Absolute quality floors (Epic #1184)](#absolute-quality-floors-epic-1184)
below for the policy and [`docs/decisions.md`](../../docs/decisions.md) (ADR
20260512-coupling-stance) for the framework-wide stance that motivates
the lift the floor gate represents.

The configuration knobs that drive these gates live in
[`.agents/docs/configuration.md`](../docs/configuration.md) under
`delivery.quality.*`. This file is the runbook side — what the gate does,
when it fires, and how to bootstrap or refresh it.

The **baseline envelope, per-kind shapes, component model, writer/reader
contract, and floor-override path** are documented in the
[Baseline reference](#baseline-reference) section at the end of this
document. Each per-gate section below cross-links to that section; consult
it once and reuse the context as you read through any individual gate.

## Concurrent close safety

`/deliver` may close multiple Stories from separate branches in quick
succession; each rebases onto the latest `main` in its own base-sync phase
(`phases/base-sync.js`) before the push, so concurrent closes serialize
through their own worktrees rather than racing one shared branch. The push
does not retry — a rejected push or a real content conflict fails the close
non-zero and leaves the tree clean for manual resolution. See
[`SDLC.md` § Concurrent close](SDLC.md#concurrent-close).

---

## Test runner concurrency

`npm test` (via [`.agents/scripts/run-tests.js`](../scripts/run-tests.js))
derives `--test-concurrency` from `os.availableParallelism()` at startup,
clamped into `[1, 16]` (`resolveTestConcurrency`). The clamp keeps the value
sane at both extremes: on the GitHub Actions 2-vCPU runner the derived value
matches the host, and on very-wide dev hosts the cap of 16 bounds the
filesystem-race surface from shared FS fixtures (`memfs` mounts, `temp/`
snapshot dirs, the `coverage/` artifact directory shared with the CRAP gate).

The coverage run is the exception: `npm run test:coverage`
([`.agents/scripts/run-coverage.js`](../scripts/run-coverage.js)) pins
`--test-concurrency=8` so coverage timings stay comparable across hosts. Any
change to the clamp bounds or the coverage pin should be validated on both a
Windows dev host and a GitHub Actions runner to confirm it doesn't reintroduce
concurrency flakes.

---

## Coverage baseline gate

> Baseline envelope, axes, and component model: see the
> [Baseline reference](#baseline-reference) section below.

`npm run test:coverage` drives
[`.agents/scripts/run-coverage.js`](../scripts/run-coverage.js),
which runs the unit-test suite with `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` set, post-processes
the V8 dumps with `c8 report`, then delegates to
[`.agents/scripts/check-baselines.js`](../scripts/check-baselines.js)
for the gate decision. There is no global `lines/branches/functions`
threshold — the gate compares **per-file** coverage in
`coverage/coverage-final.json` against the floors recorded in
[`baselines/coverage.json`](../../baselines/coverage.json) and fails on:

- a regression on any axis (lines, branches, or functions) for any file
  whose coverage dropped more than `0.01` percentage points below its
  recorded floor;
- an in-scope file with no baseline entry (a brand-new untested CLI
  shell would otherwise sail through with 0 % coverage and no recorded
  floor to drop below).

Scope (include/exclude) and reporters are declared in
[`.c8rc.cjs`](../../.c8rc.cjs); the gate reads the same file so `c8 report`
and the per-file checker agree on what's in scope. Bootstrap or
ratchet the baseline when an intentional scope change shifts coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage   # produces coverage/coverage-final.json (gate
                        # warns + passes when no baseline exists yet)
npm run coverage:update # writes baselines/coverage.json from the run
```

`npm run coverage:check` runs the gate standalone against an existing
`coverage-final.json` artifact (useful from CI hooks or close-validation
runners that orchestrate coverage capture separately).

The files-out-of-scope list is declared in [`.c8rc.cjs`](../../.c8rc.cjs) —
thin CLI shells plus the larger Story #1702 carve-out of
top-level/orchestration/git CLIs and `lib/*` glue. The `exclude[]` array is
the **single** declaration: each entry carries its rationale as an inline
comment on the line above it. Story #4922 removed the prose inventory the
header used to duplicate — two copies of one list in one file, 27 files
apart by the time it was measured. Do not reintroduce one. Every excluded
file also carries `/* node:coverage ignore file */` at the top of its source
as a second line of defence.

`.c8rc.cjs`'s `include` globs and `delivery.quality.gates.coverage.targetDirs`
in [`.agentrc.json`](../../.agentrc.json) MUST name the same roots — the gate
scores what c8 measures. `tests/c8rc-scope.test.js` asserts both invariants.

---

## Absolute quality floors (Epic #1184)

The per-file ratchet only protects against **regressions** — if a file
has been sitting at 60 % coverage or MI = 58 since the v5 baseline, the
ratchet is perfectly happy to keep it there forever. Epic #1184 layers
an absolute-threshold gate on top of the ratchet that fails the build
when any in-scope file is below floor, regardless of whether the diff
touched it:

| Metric | Floor | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage — lines | ≥ 94 % | repo rollup |
| Coverage — branches | ≥ 85 % | repo rollup |
| Coverage — functions | ≥ 87 % | repo rollup |
| Maintainability Index | ≥ 70 | repo rollup |
| CRAP — methods above 20 | ≤ 13 | repo rollup |

Floors are enforced against the baseline's `rollup` components — the
`applyFloors` phase compares `rollup["*"]` (and any named component), never
individual rows. Story #4922 corrected this table, which previously read
"per file" and quoted 90/85/90 for coverage; those numbers came from the
example in `.agents/docs/agentrc-reference.json`, which is validated only
against itself, and the coverage gate was not configured at all.

The live coverage floors are derived from the measurement in
[`baselines/coverage.json`](../../baselines/coverage.json) — a full-tier run
scored 95.65 / 86.16 / 88.52, and each floor sits ~1–1.7 points under its
axis. Re-derive them, do not invent them, whenever the baseline is
regenerated wholesale.

The coverage gate deliberately declares **no `tolerance`**, so its
head-vs-base ratchet arm reports regressions without failing the build (the
same shape the `crap` gate uses). Story #4922's scope was making the
instrument honest; arming the ratchet belongs with the debt burn-down that
the widened measurement newly exposes.

The floors are declared in [`.agentrc.json`](../../.agentrc.json) under
`delivery.quality.gates.<gate>.floors.*` (defaults baked into the helper
match the table above) and resolved at runtime by the shared
helper [`lib/orchestration/check-baselines/phases/floors.js`](../scripts/lib/orchestration/check-baselines/phases/floors.js).
All three gates run through `check-baselines.js` (coverage,
maintainability, crap), which invokes the floors phase **after** the
ratchet decision so a file that's below floor but matched the (stale)
baseline still trips the gate.

### When the floor gate fires

- **Pre-push** (`.husky/pre-push`): diff-scoped, fast path only —
  `quality-preview.js --changed-since origin/main` (MI + CRAP preview),
  then `coverage-capture.js` and `npm run crap:check` (unified
  dispatcher, diff-scoped via `delivery.quality.gateScoping`). Full-repo
  lint, docs generation checks, and the complete test suite are **not**
  run on push; use `npm run verify` locally before a PR. CI enforces the
  authoritative full gate set on every PR.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): the `validate` job runs
  **Lint and Format** (`npm run lint`), a **Maintainability Check**
  (`npm run maintainability:check` → `check-baselines.js --gate
  maintainability`, diff-scoped on PRs via
  `delivery.quality.gateScoping`, full scope on push-to-main via
  `BASELINE_SCOPE=full`), and **Run Tests with Coverage**
  (`npm run test:coverage`), uploading the `test-results` and
  `coverage-final` artifacts. A separate required **baselines** job runs
  the unified `node .agents/scripts/check-baselines.js --format text`,
  which enforces floors across every configured gate.

### Opt-out

There is no floor opt-out flag on the check path. The `*:update`
baseline-snap scripts snapshot whatever the current numbers are without
floor enforcement **by construction** — they are writers, not gates —
so no disable switch exists or is needed (the floors phase at
[`lib/orchestration/check-baselines/phases/floors.js`](../scripts/lib/orchestration/check-baselines/phases/floors.js)
has no off switch).

### No silent excludes (`.c8rc.cjs` policy)

The floor gate is only as strict as its scope, so the `exclude` list in
[`.c8rc.cjs`](../../.c8rc.cjs) carries three hard requirements that are
enforced by review (and partially by the audit suite):

1. **One-line rationale per entry.** Every file in `exclude[]` MUST carry
   an inline comment on the line(s) directly above it naming *why* it is
   excluded — typically "thin CLI shell, meaningful logic lives in
   `lib/<X>` and is unit-tested there." A bare path with no rationale is a
   review-block, and `tests/c8rc-scope.test.js` fails on one.
2. **`/* node:coverage ignore file */` pragma at source.** Every
   excluded file MUST carry the Node coverage pragma at the top of its
   own source. This is the second line of defence: when `c8 report` and
   the baseline checker disagree about scope (different cwd, different
   glob expansion, partial install), the pragma keeps the file out of
   the gate's numerator from the inside.
3. **Excluded file's callees clear the floor.** A CLI shell is only a
   legitimate exclude if the `lib/` module it wraps actually clears the
   floor (coverage 90/85/90, MI ≥ 70, CRAP ≤ 20). Excluding a shell
   that delegates to under-tested helpers re-introduces the very
   risk the floor gate exists to surface; the audit suite spot-checks
   the callee map at exclude-list churn time.

## Anti-thrashing protocol

The qualitative anti-thrashing cues are owned by
[`.agents/instructions.md`](../instructions.md) § 1.I. When they trip, the
friction logger flips the Story to `agent::blocked` and posts a structured
`friction` comment on the Story so the operator has the trace.

---

## Per-Story acceptance self-eval gate

After a Story's implementation commits land and **before** it proceeds to
close, delivery runs a bounded acceptance self-eval loop: a fresh-context
critic scores the caller-injected change set against every inline
`acceptance[]` item (using `verify[]` output as evidence) and yields
**proceed** / **redraft** / **block**. This gate is complementary to the
close-validation chain above — that chain proves the code is *healthy*, this
loop proves it satisfies *this Story's* acceptance criteria. The per-round
mechanic is owned by
[`helpers/acceptance-self-eval`](../workflows/helpers/acceptance-self-eval.md)
(Step 1a of [`helpers/deliver-story`](../workflows/helpers/deliver-story.md));
the `delivery.acceptanceEval` field reference is in
[`configuration.md`](../docs/configuration.md).

---

## Lint baseline ratchet

> Baseline envelope, axes, and component model: see the
> [Baseline reference](#baseline-reference) section below.

The lint baseline engine enforces zero-deterioration during Story
delivery. Integrations fail if new lint warnings are introduced, and the
baseline automatically tightens when the codebase improves.

The canonical baseline file lives at `baselines/lint.json` (override via
`delivery.quality.gates.lint.baselinePath`). Refresh with:

```bash
node .agents/scripts/lint-baseline.js capture
```

Refresh commits should use a `baseline-refresh:` subject + non-empty body so
the operator can spot baseline edits in review — same convention as the CRAP
and maintainability ratchets. There is no CI guardrail enforcing the
convention; the operator is the gate.

---

## Maintainability ratchet

> Baseline envelope, axes, and component model: see the
> [Baseline reference](#baseline-reference) section below.

A per-file maintainability scoring engine computes composite scores based
on cyclomatic complexity, file length, and dependency counts. The
`baselines/maintainability.json` baseline prevents score degradation
between Stories.

Refresh with `npm run maintainability:update`.

`delivery.quality.gates.maintainability.targetDirs` controls the scanned
directories (see [`configuration.md`](../docs/configuration.md) for the
default and the deep-merge extender form).

---

## Cyclomatic ceiling ratchet

`delivery.quality.codingGuardrails.cyclomaticMustFix` (default `12`) is the
per-function complexity ceiling, enforced by `check-cyclomatic.js`. It is a
**standalone ratchet** — the same slot as `check-arch-cycles.js`,
`check-dead-exports.js`, and `check-context-budget.js` — not a
`delivery.quality.gates` kind, so it needs no gate block and no floor.

```bash
node .agents/scripts/check-cyclomatic.js            # the gate
node .agents/scripts/check-cyclomatic.js --update   # re-record the breaches
```

`baselines/cyclomatic.json` records, per file, how many functions currently
sit above the ceiling and how bad the worst one is. The gate fails when a
file's over-ceiling count rises (including `0 → 1`, a brand-new breach) or
when its worst function gets worse than recorded. Shrinking and disappearing
are the success signals and never fail.

Recording existing breaches is what makes the ceiling adoptable: a repository
with dozens of over-ceiling functions can turn the gate on today and burn them
down on its own schedule, instead of disabling a gate that fails on the first
commit. Re-run `--update` after a deliberate refactor; that is the only motion
allowed to raise a recorded count, and it shows up in review as a baseline
diff.

The scan reuses `delivery.quality.gates.maintainability.targetDirs` /
`ignoreGlobs` — both instruments read the same coverage-free escomplex
surface, so a separate scope declaration could only ever restate it.

`cyclomaticFlag` (default `8`) is the softer half of the pair: it is not
gated, and names the ceiling `quality:preview` counts new methods against in
its `new-method count over c=<flag>` column.

---

## CRAP gate — Consumer onboarding

> Baseline envelope, axes, and component model: see the
> [Baseline reference](#baseline-reference) section below.

A sibling per-method gate alongside the maintainability ratchet. CRAP
scores each JavaScript method via `c² · (1 − cov)³ + c`, combining
`typhonjs-escomplex` cyclomatic complexity with per-method coverage from
the `coverage/coverage-final.json` artifact your test runner already
produces. No new runtime dependencies. Runs at three sites:
`close-validation` (story close), `ci.yml` (push + PR), and
`.husky/pre-push`.

If you're a consumer repo that installed the framework via the
`mandrel` npm package (`mandrel sync`), this is what you need to know.

### First-run behavior — bootstrap before the first push

As of Story #791 the gate is hard-enforcing across all three firing sites
(close-validation, pre-push, CI). With `crap.enabled: true` and no
`baselines/crap.json` on disk, the CRAP gate (`npm run crap:check`)
prints:

```text
[CRAP] ❌ no baseline found — run the matching baseline-update command and commit with a 'baseline-refresh:' subject to bootstrap
```

…and exits `1`. Bootstrap explicitly: run `npm run test:coverage` to
produce `coverage/coverage-final.json`, then `npm run crap:update` to
generate `baselines/crap.json`, and commit the file with a
`baseline-refresh:` tagged subject + non-empty body so the
refresh-guardrail accepts it on the next PR.

If your test runner doesn't produce per-method coverage, see "Disabling the
gate" below.

### Disabling the gate (single-flag opt-out)

If your repo doesn't run coverage, set `enabled: false` in your
`.agentrc.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "delivery": {
    "quality": {
      "gates": {
        "crap": { "enabled": false }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All three gate sites self-skip with `[CRAP] gate skipped (disabled)` — no
source edits required. The maintainability ratchet keeps running.

### Extending `targetDirs` without re-listing framework defaults

`targetDirs` (like the other list-valued gate keys) accepts the deep-merge
extender form — `{ "append": [...] }` / `{ "prepend": [...] }` add to the
framework default (`["src"]`), while a plain array replaces it entirely. The
worked example and the general rule live once in
[`configuration.md` § How to extend](../docs/configuration.md#how-to-extend).

### Interpreting the JSON report

`npm run crap:check` runs the unified dispatcher
(`check-baselines.js --gate crap`), which emits its structured report on
**stdout** — `--format json` is the default (pass `--format text` for the
human-readable summary). There is no file-writing flag; to capture a file
artifact, redirect:

```bash
npm run crap:check > temp/crap-report.json
```

CI does **not** upload a `crap-report` artifact — `ci.yml` uploads only
`test-results` (the test/coverage run log) and `coverage-final`
(`coverage/coverage-final.json`).

The JSON envelope is the unified check-baselines report (see
[`lib/orchestration/check-baselines/phases/report.js`](../scripts/lib/orchestration/check-baselines/phases/report.js)):
top-level totals (`totalBreaches`, `totalRegressions`,
`kernelDriftCount`, `schemaErrors`) plus a `gates[]` array where each
gate entry carries its `kind`, breach/regression counts,
kernel-version match info, and per-`components[]` floor `violations[]`
(`axis`, `value`, `floor`, `direction`).

### Refreshing the baseline (when the drift is justified)

`npm run crap:update` regenerates `baselines/crap.json`. The refresh
should land in a commit whose:

1. Subject starts with the configured `refreshTag` (default
   `baseline-refresh:`).
2. Body is non-empty and explains why the refresh is justified.

There is no CI guardrail rejecting unlabeled baseline edits; the convention is
preserved so the operator can grep refresh commits in a PR diff, but
self-policing is the operator's job during `/deliver`'s watch loop.

### The per-method coverage join (Story #4775)

CRAP is the only gate that joins two independently-produced artifacts: the
per-method complexity escomplex derives from the source, and the per-function
coverage istanbul derives from the test run. Everything below exists because
that join is silent when it fails — an unresolved method is simply absent from
the baseline, so a broken join looks exactly like a small repo.

**One coordinate system.** For a TS/TSX source, escomplex parses the
*transpiled* output and reports each method's `lineStart` in transpiled
coordinates, while `coverage-final.json` is keyed against the *original*
source. The scorer therefore asks `transpileIfNeeded` for a source map
(`{ withLineMap: true }`, backed by Node's built-in `SourceMap` — no extra
runtime dependency) and remaps each method start into original coordinates
before the lookup. JavaScript is a passthrough: its coordinates already are
original coordinates, so no map is computed and nothing changes. The
maintainability path never requests a map, and the emitted code is
byte-identical either way, so MI scores are unaffected.

**Tolerant matching.** Remapping alone is insufficient: escomplex's method
start and istanbul's `decl.start.line` disagree by a line when a decorator, a
leading `export`, or a wrapped parameter list sits between them. The lookup is
exact-line first (so every already-resolving row keeps its exact prior value),
then innermost containment, then nearest declaration within ±1.

**`requireCoverage: false` means score it.** A method with no coverage entry
scores as 0% covered — `crap = c² + c`, the formula's own treatment of
untested code — and lands in the baseline. It used to be dropped individually
regardless of the flag, which made the flag a no-op for baseline population.
`requireCoverage: true` still skips and counts it.

**The updater fails closed on a thin result.** `update-crap-baseline.js`
reports `resolved/joinable` over files that *have* coverage and refuses to
persist below `delivery.quality.gates.crap.minMethodResolutionRate` (default
`0.75`), naming the worst unresolved files. The floor is not enforced below 25
joinable methods, where a diff-scoped run's rate is noise. A healthy repo
resolves ~98%; the 4–6% signature of a coordinate-system mismatch is far below
the floor.

**Re-derive your floors after adopting this — but do not re-pin `max`.** A
`crap.floors` `max` ceiling pinned before the fix was computed over the
minority of methods the join could see, so it is not a real ceiling — it is an
artefact. The honest scan sees far more (in this repository, 2215 → 4058
visible methods), and the newly-visible methods include the worst ones.

The tempting response — raise `*.max` until the gate is green again — produces a
floor fitted to the tree's current high-water mark, which **can never fire**:
nothing breaches it until something becomes worse than the worst method already
present. Prefer a *count* budget over a max ceiling:

```jsonc
"crap": {
  // Number of methods allowed to score above 20. Ratchet this down; it
  // breaches the moment the count grows, which a `max` ceiling cannot do.
  "floors": { "*": { "methodsAbove20": 40 } }
}
```

`max` remains available and is the right instrument when you genuinely have a
hard per-method ceiling to hold. It is the wrong instrument for absorbing
pre-existing debt.

Note that neither choice is what protects new code. `floors` is an absolute
tree-wide comparison against the rollup; the forward pressure lives in
`newMethodCeiling` (a *new* method scoring above it fails, default 30) and in
`compareCrap`'s ratchet (an *existing* method fails when it regresses against
its own baseline row). Both are unaffected by how much old debt the gate can
now see, and neither consults `floors`.

**Old baselines are invalidated explicitly.** Rows scored by the previous join
are not comparable to rows scored by this one, and neither `kernelVersion` nor
`escomplexVersion` moves (both track the same upstream package). The envelope
therefore carries a `scoringSemantics` stamp; `check-baselines` fails closed on
a mismatch with the exact re-baseline command rather than comparing across the
boundary. Bump the stamp whenever the coverage join, the line coordinate
system, the unresolved-method policy, or the method identity rule changes —
Story #4969 bumped it for the last of these, replacing escomplex's positional
`<anon method-N>` label with an enclosing-scope-path identity.

---

## Keeping a baseline fresh (Story #4776)

Populating a baseline correctly is only half the loop. The other half is
keeping it correct as the tree grows, and that half has two distinct holes —
one at close time, one over the long run. Both are **advisory**:
`check-baselines` already fails closed on a real regression, and duplicating
that would double-gate the same defect.

### Pre-merge projections — the refresh nudge at close time

Close-validation projects, after its gates pass, which committed baseline rows
the post-merge tree would breach, and names the exact remedy while the operator
still has the branch in hand:

- `lib/close-validation/projections/maintainability.js` — per-file MI.
- `lib/close-validation/projections/crap.js` — per-method CRAP, against each
  method's baseline row or, for methods with no row, `newMethodCeiling`.

Both are wired through `projections/advisories.js`, which
`close-validation/runner.js` calls once. Each self-skips — logging the reason,
never erroring — when its gate is disabled, when no baseline exists, when the
diff has no scorable files, or when the CRAP scorer finds no coverage
artifact. A projected breach never changes the close verdict.

> The maintainability projection shipped in v1 fully written and fully
> unit-tested, and the v2 Epic-tier collapse removed its only caller. It sat
> importable-but-unimported for the whole of v2, so its advisory never fired
> once. `tests/lib/close-validation/runner-projections.test.js` now walks the
> import graph and fails if **any** module under `projections/` is reachable
> from nothing in production — the orphaning itself is the regression.

### `check-baseline-drift.js` — the scheduled full-scope re-score

Every per-PR enforcement site (close-validation, pre-push, CI) is
**diff-scoped**: it compares the files a branch touched against their baseline
rows. A file nobody touches after its row is written is therefore never
re-scored, so drift introduced *indirectly* — a dependency getting more
complex, coverage moving underneath a method — stays invisible indefinitely.
Full-scope scoring on every push is far too expensive to be the answer.

```bash
node .agents/scripts/check-baseline-drift.js                     # both kinds
node .agents/scripts/check-baseline-drift.js --gate crap         # one kind
node .agents/scripts/check-baseline-drift.js --tolerance 1 --json
```

It re-scores full-scope through the *same* scorer that writes the baseline
(`refresh-service.resolveDefaultScorer`) — scoring by a second implementation
would report the two implementations' disagreement as drift — and prints a
per-row before/after table for everything that moved beyond the gate's
tolerance, **in either direction**. A row that silently improved is equally
strong evidence the baseline no longer describes the tree.

Exit codes: `0` no drift (or every kind skipped), `1` drift detected, `2` the
check could not run. It is designed to be wired as a scheduled CI job;
scheduling it is deliberately consumer-side work, and nothing in this
repository runs it automatically.

## Bundle-size ratchet — one-shot refresh/acknowledge (Story #151)

> Baseline envelope, axes, and component model: see the
> [Baseline reference](#baseline-reference) section below.

`check-baselines --gate bundle-size` is a **strict** ratchet: it diffs the
branch's committed `baselines/bundle-size.json` (head) against the base
ref's copy (`origin/main` by default) using the gate's configured
`tolerance`, and separately checks the head aggregate against `floors`.
Unlike `coverage` / `crap` / `maintainability`, bundle-size has **no
scorer of its own** — the measured `rawKb` / `gzippedKb` numbers come from
whatever build step the consumer already runs, not a source-tree rescan —
so there is no `refreshBaseline({ kind: 'bundle-size', ... })` path to
regenerate a "corrected" baseline the way `npm run crap:update` does.

This makes an **intentional** bundle-size growth (a framework major bump,
a new dependency, an SSR runtime swap) impossible to land cleanly with the
usual levers: permanently raising `tolerance` in `.agentrc.json` disables
the ratchet for every *future* PR too, not just the one that legitimately
grew.

### `BUNDLE_SIZE_REFRESH=1`

Set the environment variable for the one CI/local run that needs to land
the growth:

```bash
BUNDLE_SIZE_REFRESH=1 npm run bundle-size:check
# or, calling the dispatcher directly:
BUNDLE_SIZE_REFRESH=1 node .agents/scripts/check-baselines.js --gate bundle-size
```

When set (`1` or `true`, case-insensitive), every `bundle-size`
head-vs-base regression is demoted to `unchanged` **for that invocation
only** — the gate compares head-vs-head in effect, so it passes even
though the committed baseline grew. **Floors still apply**: an
acknowledged PR can still fail if the head aggregate breaches the
configured `floors` budget, so a genuinely runaway regression isn't
silently waved through under the guise of "intentional".

Commit the regenerated `baselines/bundle-size.json` (reflecting the real,
larger sizes) in the same PR so the new numbers become the base for the
*next* PR's diff.

### The ratchet returns to full strength automatically

`BUNDLE_SIZE_REFRESH` is read fresh on every invocation and is **never
persisted** — no config write, no committed tag, no lingering state. The
very next `check-baselines --gate bundle-size` run (i.e. the next PR),
without the env var set, re-enforces the ratchet at full strength against
the now-larger committed baseline. There is nothing to remember to reset.

This mirrors the `CRAP_TOLERANCE` env-override precedent (see
[CRAP gate — Consumer onboarding](#crap-gate--consumer-onboarding) above),
but as a true one-shot acknowledgment rather than a run-scoped tolerance
override: `CRAP_TOLERANCE` changes the *threshold*, `BUNDLE_SIZE_REFRESH`
demotes the *outcome* of an already-flagged regression, which is the
correct shape for a gate with no rescoring path of its own.

## HITL blocker escalation

`risk::high` is planning/audit metadata only — it never pauses runtime. The
sole runtime HITL pause point is `agent::blocked`; `planning.riskHeuristics`
is the rubric for what should escalate. The full model is owned by
[`.agents/instructions.md`](../instructions.md) § 1.J and
[`SDLC.md` § HITL model](SDLC.md#hitl-human-in-the-loop-model).

## Baseline reference

This is the authoritative reference for the canonical baseline shape used
by every quality gate in the framework — `lint`, `coverage`, `crap`,
`maintainability`, `mutation`, `lighthouse`, and `bundle-size`. It covers
the envelope, the per-kind shapes, the component model, how paths are
canonicalised, the writer/reader contract, how consumers override floors,
and how kernel-version drift surfaces as friction. The runbook sections
above describe the runtime behaviour of each gate (when it fires, what it
asserts, how to refresh); this section is the data-shape contract those
gates read and write.

Cross-references:

- [`.agents/docs/configuration.md`](../docs/configuration.md) — the `.agentrc.json`
  configuration surface that backs the gates.
- [`.agents/README.md`](../README.md) — consumer onboarding.

> The `mutation` gate ships **dormant** (built-but-unwired, intentionally
> opt-in). The former `update-mutation-baseline.js` refresh CLI was retired
> with the rest of the zero-consumer script surface (#4482); the
> `lib/mutation/` snapshot machinery remains for a future activation.

### Envelope

Every baseline file under `baselines/<kind>.json` shares the same
top-level envelope:

```json
{
  "$schema": ".agents/schemas/baselines/<kind>.schema.json",
  "kernelVersion": "1.1.0",
  "generatedAt": "2026-05-15T19:30:00.000Z",
  "rollup": {
    "*": { "<axis>": <number>, "...": <number> }
  },
  "rows": [
    { "path": "<repo-relative-path>", "<axis>": <number>, "...": <number> }
  ]
}
```

| Field           | Purpose                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$schema`       | Per-kind JSON Schema path. Drives validation in the shared AJV.   |
| `kernelVersion` | Version stamp of the writer that produced the file. See below.    |
| `generatedAt`   | ISO 8601 timestamp; advisory — not load-bearing for gate logic.   |
| `rollup`        | Per-component aggregate keyed by component name. `*` is required. |
| `rows`          | Sorted, canonicalised per-file (or per-route/per-bundle) entries. |

The schemas live under [`.agents/schemas/baselines/`](../schemas/baselines/).
The shared AJV instance is built by `buildBaselineSchemaAjv()` in
[`.agents/scripts/lib/baseline-schema-registry.js`](../scripts/lib/baseline-schema-registry.js).

### Per-kind shapes

Each kind contributes a `rows[]` schema and a `rollup` axis set. The
authoritative declarations live in the per-kind modules at
[`.agents/scripts/lib/baselines/kinds/`](../scripts/lib/baselines/kinds/):

| Kind              | Key field | Row axes                                                       | Rollup axes                              |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `lint`            | `path`    | `errorCount`, `warningCount`                                   | `errorCount`, `warningCount`             |
| `coverage`        | `path`    | `lines`, `branches`, `functions`, `statements`                 | `lines`, `branches`, `functions`         |
| `crap`            | `path`    | `method`, `startLine`, `crap`                                  | `max`, `p95`, `methodsAboveCeiling`      |
| `maintainability` | `path`    | `maintainability`                                              | `min`, `p50`, `p95`                      |
| `mutation`        | `path`    | `score`, `killed`, `survived`, `noCoverage`, `timeout`, `total`| `score`, `survived`, `noCoverage`        |
| `lighthouse`      | `route`   | `route`, `performance`, `accessibility`, `bestPractices`, `seo`| per-category scores                      |
| `bundle-size`     | `bundle`  | `bundle`, `bytes`, `gzippedBytes`                              | `bytes`, `gzippedBytes`                  |

The `keyField` is the per-row identifier the writer canonicalises and the
component grouper matches against (see below). Lighthouse keys rows on
`route`; bundle-size keys on `bundle`; every other kind keys on `path`.

### Component model

A component is a named bucket of rows that share a floor and a tolerance.
Components let an operator slice a baseline so per-component floors can
be evaluated independently (e.g. `api`, `worker`, `infra` each with its
own coverage floor).

Shape:

```json
"components": {
  "<name>": ["<glob>", "<glob>", "..."]
}
```

Rules:

- The component literally named `*` is the **whole-repo bucket** and
  captures every row regardless of declared globs. Every baseline emits
  `rollup['*']` for backwards compatibility with pre-component gates.
- Glob matching uses
  [`minimatch`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) with `dot: true`.
- **Overlap is allowed by design** — a row matched by two components is
  reported under both.
- When a gate omits `components`, the default is `{ "*": ["**"] }`. The
  resolver lives in
  [`.agents/scripts/lib/baselines/components.js`](../scripts/lib/baselines/components.js)
  (`resolveComponents` + `groupRows`).

### Path canonicalisation

Every path-like field in a baseline (`rows[].path`, `rows[].route`,
`rows[].bundle`) is canonicalised to a forward-slashed, repo-relative
form before it is written:

- Windows backslashes are normalised to forward slashes.
- Leading `./` is stripped.
- A `.worktrees/<workspace>/` prefix — which would leak into a hand-edit
  made inside a story worktree — is stripped.
- Absolute paths are rejected (the writer throws rather than silently
  rewrite identity).

The canonicaliser lives at
[`.agents/scripts/lib/baselines/path-canon.js`](../scripts/lib/baselines/path-canon.js).
The reader applies a defensive second pass (`canonicaliseRowPath`) when
loading so downstream consumers never have to special-case the worktree
prefix.

### Writer/reader contract

The single funnel for **writing** a baseline is
[`.agents/scripts/lib/baselines/writer.js`](../scripts/lib/baselines/writer.js)
— `write({ kind, rows, components, kernelVersion?, generatedAt? })`:

1. Resolve the per-kind module from the kernel registry.
2. Project every row through `projectRow` (which canonicalises the key
   field and asserts the result with `assertCanonical`).
3. Sort the rows deterministically for stable on-disk diffs.
4. Compute the per-component rollup, always including `*`.
5. Stamp `$schema`, `kernelVersion`, and `generatedAt` via
   `buildEnvelope`.
6. Validate the envelope against the per-kind schema via the shared AJV.
7. Return the envelope. `writeFile(absPath, envelope)` is the separate
   serialise + atomic-rename seam.

The single funnel for **reading** a baseline is
[`.agents/scripts/lib/baselines/reader.js`](../scripts/lib/baselines/reader.js)
— `reader.load(kind, { cwd?, configPath? })`:

1. Resolve the on-disk path from `delivery.quality.gates.<kind>.baselinePath`,
   falling back to the canonical default (`baselines/<kind>.json`).
2. Read the file as UTF-8 JSON.
3. Validate against the per-kind schema.
4. Apply the defensive path canonicalisation pass to `rows[]`.
5. Return `{ rollup, rows, kernelVersion, generatedAt }`.

Every gate reads through this module — the unified
[`check-baselines.js`](../scripts/check-baselines.js) dispatcher
(whose per-kind gate logic lives in
[`.agents/scripts/lib/baselines/kinds/`](../scripts/lib/baselines/kinds/)
— `lint.js`, `coverage.js`, `crap.js`, `maintainability.js`,
`mutation.js`, etc.), the audit-suite delta emitter, and the
per-component drift signals. No gate opens
`JSON.parse(readFileSync(...))` of a baseline directly.

`loadFile(absolutePath, { kind? })` is the same contract for ad-hoc
fixture paths; the kind is inferred from `$schema` when not supplied.

### Floor overrides

Consumers override floors per gate in `.agentrc.json` under
`delivery.quality.gates.<kind>`:

```json
{
  "delivery": {
    "quality": {
      "gates": {
        "coverage": {
          "floors": {
            "*": { "lines": 90, "branches": 85, "functions": 90 },
            "api": { "lines": 95, "branches": 90, "functions": 95 }
          },
          "components": {
            "api": ["src/api/**", "src/server/**"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Behaviour:

- `floors['*']` is the whole-repo floor. Every gate falls back to `*`
  when a component-scoped floor is not declared.
- A per-component floor overrides `*` for that component only. Other
  components still inherit `*`.
- The `components` map is optional. When omitted, the default
  `{ "*": ["**"] }` applies and only `*` rows are ever evaluated.
- The unified `check-baselines.js` reports breaches per component, with
  `*` always present in the output. The shared baselines kernel
  (`lib/baselines/kernel.js`, via the per-kind rollups in
  `lib/baselines/kinds/`) groups rows by component and names the
  breached component in its output so a `*` rollup is not falsely
  implicated when only a component-scoped floor was crossed.

#### Floor axes must match rollup axes

A configured floor axis is only enforced when the rollup actually exposes
that axis — `check-baselines.js#compareToFloor` skips axes whose value is
missing from the rollup. As of Story #2193, the unified dispatcher
**fails closed** when a configured floor axis is absent from the rollup:
the gate exits non-zero with an actionable error naming the missing axis
and listing the available rollup keys (so a typo like
`{ maintainability: 70 }` against the maintainability rollup — which
exposes `min` / `p50` / `p95` — surfaces immediately instead of silently
passing).

Match the floor axis names to the rollup axes documented in the [Per-kind
shapes](#per-kind-shapes) table above. For maintainability specifically:

```json
{
  "delivery": {
    "quality": {
      "gates": {
        "maintainability": {
          "floors": {
            "*": { "min": 70 }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The maintainability rollup exposes `min` (lowest per-file `mi`), `p50`
(median), and `p95` (95th percentile); a floor on `min` is the framework
default and enforces a hard lower bound on individual files. Floors keyed
on the legacy `maintainability` axis (which never appears in the rollup)
are rejected with an explanatory error.

For the full configuration surface (every gate-level key with defaults
and types) see [`.agents/docs/configuration.md`](../docs/configuration.md) and the
`delivery.quality.*` section.

#### Shipped surface vs follow-up

The unified [`check-baselines.js`](../scripts/check-baselines.js)
ships **floor + tolerance + schema + kernel-mismatch** logic and is the
**only** baseline gate. Epic #1943 (Story #1981) absorbed the per-kind
regression / scope / git-base-ref logic and deleted the per-kind
`check-<kind>.js` CLIs (no `check-coverage.js`, `check-crap.js`, or
`check-maintainability.js` exists in `.agents/scripts/`; see the
`baselines` job comment in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and the
Story #2210 note in
`.agents/scripts/lib/close-validation/gates.js`). Consumers wire only
the unified `baselines` status check into branch protection (see
`.agentrc.json` → `github.branchProtection.requiredChecks`).

### Kernel-version friction

Every per-kind module exports a `kernelVersion()` function that returns
the writer's version of the analysis it produces. The writer stamps the
version on the envelope; the reader returns it; the unified gate
compares it against the running kernel.

When `baseline.kernelVersion !== runningKernelVersion`, the gate emits a
`baseline-kernel-mismatch` friction signal (suppressed with
`--no-friction`) but does **not** change its exit code — kernel drift is
advisory. The friction record points the reviewer at the regenerate
workflow for the kind in question.

Refresh paths:

- `npm run test:coverage` then `npm run coverage:update` — rewrites
  `baselines/coverage.json`.
- `node .agents/scripts/update-crap-baseline.js` — rewrites
  `baselines/crap.json`.
- `node .agents/scripts/update-maintainability-baseline.js` — rewrites
  `baselines/maintainability.json`.
- `node .agents/scripts/lint-baseline.js capture` — rewrites
  `baselines/lint.json`.

After a kernel bump, regenerate every baseline whose `kernelVersion`
drifted, then commit the refreshed files. The writer guarantees
deterministic ordering and canonical paths, so the diff is the kernel
delta and nothing else.
