# Known Tooling Behavior

This rule applies when you are about to trust the output of a gate, a
baseline ratchet, or a local stand-in for a CI check — before pushing,
before declaring a check green, and before diagnosing a red one.

Each entry below records a **measured** behavior of this repository's own
tooling: a place where a command's visible output does not mean what it
looks like it means. Entries exist because each one has already cost a
delivery cycle.

## The entry bar

- An entry states behavior that was **measured against this repo**, never
  recalled and never assumed.
- Every entry carries a **reproduction command** that was actually run. If
  the command stops reproducing the behavior, **delete the entry** — do not
  annotate it. A stale entry is worse than a missing one, because it is
  trusted.
- Entries describe the observable behavior and the safe move. They never
  describe a way to bypass a gate, and recording a behavior here is not a
  decision to keep it.

## 1. `npm run lint` prints `Summary: 0 error(s)` and can still exit 1

**Behavior.** `npm run lint` is `run-lint.js`, which spawns eight tools
concurrently with inherited stdio and exits with the first non-zero code —
Biome, markdownlint-cli2, the lifecycle lint, the workflow-CLI lint, the
label-vocabulary lint, the workflow-timeout gate, the arch-cycle ratchet, and
the Gherkin corpus gate. `Summary: 0 error(s)` is **markdownlint-cli2's own
verdict**, not the aggregate — it is printed whether or not any of the other
seven failed. Because the tools run in parallel, that line can land anywhere
in the output, including last, so the tail of a failing run reads green.
Biome's format diagnostics are `error`-severity, so a file that only needs
reformatting fails the check while emitting no lint rule name at all.

**Reproduce.**

```bash
# a format-only diff is an error, not a warning
printf 'export const x = {a:1,   b:2};\n' | npx biome check --stdin-file-path=probe.js
echo "biome exit=$?"   # 1 — "The contents aren't fixed"

# and markdownlint's Summary line is unconditional
npm run lint 2>&1 | grep -c 'Summary: 0 error(s)'
```

**Safe move.** Trust the exit code, never the last line. When `npm run lint`
exits non-zero and you cannot see why, re-run `npx biome ci .` on its own —
`.agents/scripts/run-lint.js` lists every tool it fans out to. Fix formatting
with `npm run format`; never reach for `--no-verify`.

## 2. `check-baselines.js` is not the whole `baselines` check

**Behavior.** `.agentrc.json` declares the `baselines` required check as
`node .agents/scripts/check-baselines.js`, but that script only runs the
gates configured under `delivery.quality.gates` — currently **crap,
maintainability, and duplication**. CI's job named `baselines` in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs that script **and then nine standalone
commands** the script knows nothing about, so a locally green
`check-baselines.js` is not evidence that the `baselines` check will pass.

| Command CI's `baselines` job runs | Covered by `check-baselines.js` | Covered by `npm run lint` | Covered by `npm run verify` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `check-arch-cycles.js` | no | **yes** | via `lint` |
| `check-dead-exports.js` | no | no | **yes** |
| `check-dead-exports.js --production` | no | no | **yes** |
| `check-context-budget.js` | no | no | **yes** |
| `check-workflow-citations.js` | no | no | **no** |
| `check-cyclomatic.js` | no | no | **yes** |
| `check-schema-references.js` | no | no | **yes** |
| `check-knip-entries.js` | no | no | **yes** |
| `check-baseline-scope.js` | no | no | **no** |

Two are still in **no** local aggregate command —
`check-workflow-citations.js` and `check-baseline-scope.js`. Each is reachable
only as its own npm script (`check:workflow-citations`, `baselines:scope`) or a
direct invocation.

`prune-baseline-orphans.js --check` left this table in v2.32.0: it no longer
runs in CI in any mode. It reports the same absent / out-of-scope rows as
`check-baseline-scope.js` but without merge-base attribution, so holding it in
the required job made the scope gate's inherited-divergence warning
unreachable — a stale row on `main` red every open PR regardless of who landed
it. It stays the operator's remedy, via `npm run baselines:prune`.

`check-context-budget.js` additionally runs in `.husky/pre-push`. It is
zero-tolerance in **both** directions — a change that *shrinks* the
always-loaded doc closure reds it exactly as growth does, and the remedy is a
committed baseline refresh, not a smaller diff.

**Reproduce.**

```bash
node .agents/scripts/check-baselines.js --format text   # names the 3 gates it ran
sed -n '/name: baselines/,/windows-smoke/p' .github/workflows/ci.yml | grep 'js'
grep "label: '" .agents/scripts/run-verify.js            # the 9 steps verify covers
```

**Safe move.** `npm run verify` is the closest local mirror. Run
`node .agents/scripts/check-workflow-citations.js` alongside it when the change
touches workflow prose under `.agents/workflows/`, and
`npm run baselines:scope && npm run baselines:prune -- --check` when it adds,
deletes or moves files inside a scored `targetDirs` root. Reproducing only the
`.agentrc.json` command before a push is a false green.

## 3. The two dead-export passes disagree, and the production pass is silent without `!`

**Behavior.** `check-dead-exports.js` runs twice with two separate
baselines. The default pass treats `tests/**` as knip entry points, so an
export whose only importer is a test still reads as *used*; the
`--production` pass discounts test importers and therefore sees a much
larger surface — `baselines/dead-exports.json` carries 130 rows against
`baselines/dead-exports-production.json`'s 695. A new export that is only
imported by its test passes the default pass and fails the production one.

Rows come in two shapes. `{ file, symbol: '<name>' }` is one unused export;
`{ file, symbol: '*' }` is **whole-file death** — a module nothing imports.
Knip reports such a module once, under its `files` category, and suppresses
that module's per-export rows, so a file losing its last importer *shrinks*
the export row set. Reading only `exports` therefore scored losing a whole
module as an improvement; the `*` rows exist so it reads as the regression
it is. `knip.json` lists the `.agents/scripts` CLIs as explicit entry paths
for the same reason: a blanket `.agents/scripts/*.js!` glob declared every
top-level CLI reachable by construction, so no uninvoked one could ever
surface. Adding a CLI means adding its entry line.

The production pass depends entirely on the `!` suffix on the `entry` and
`project` patterns in `knip.json`: `!` marks a pattern as
production-relevant. Strip the suffixes and `knip --production` reports
**zero** export rows and exits clean — a green that means "nothing was
analyzed", not "nothing is dead".

**Reproduce.**

```bash
node .agents/scripts/check-dead-exports.js              # default pass
node .agents/scripts/check-dead-exports.js --production # strictly larger row set
grep -c '!"' knip.json                                  # the production markers
```

**Safe move.** Run both passes before pushing. When an export is genuinely
test-only, keep it and refresh both baselines deliberately with `npm run
dead-exports:update` — `.agents/scripts/update-dead-exports-baseline.js`,
which rewrites the rows knip currently reports and fails closed rather than
persisting an empty snapshot from a knip run that never worked. Never
hand-edit `baselines/dead-exports*.json`: a hand-written row set is the one
input no gate re-derives. `.agents/rules/test-seams.md` governs which seams
are sanctioned. Never remove the `!` suffixes from `knip.json` to quieten the
production pass.
