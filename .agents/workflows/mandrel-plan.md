## Inputs

Single planning path — there is no Epic/Story router, no scope-triage
`epic|story` verdict (Gate #3's container groups, never routes). **Derive the
mode from what the operator typed, announce it, act**:

| Invocation | Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/mandrel-plan` | ask | Ask what to plan; nothing runs first. |
| `/mandrel-plan add a --json flag to doctor` | seed | Ideation from prose → **one Story by default** → persist. |
| `/mandrel-plan temp/notes/idea.md` | seed-file | Same, from notes. An existing file is a path, not prose. |
| `/mandrel-plan 4712[,4713…]` | tickets | Fetch issue(s), analyze into proper Stories (prefer N=1 rewrite). |
| `/mandrel-plan 4712`, already delivered | amends | Amend a shipped Story from a **delta envelope**. |

**Resolving a bare id.** Read live state rather than asking: `agent::done` can
only be amended, an open unplanned issue only planned. **Announce the
derivation** — "4712 is `agent::done` → amending". Ask **only** for an open
Story already at `agent::ready`.

## Saying what you want

No flags to remember — state intent; the workflow fills in the CLI
([ref](helpers/plan-reference.md)). Run scripts with `--help`.

`--yes` is **runner-set, never operator-typed** — cron, `/loop`, and headless
dispatch set it to mean *nobody is at the keyboard*, which auto-proceeds the
gates below (#1 and #2) and skips #3. Never offer it to an operator.

## Default-single split policy

Author **one Story** unless the pieces have **near-zero overlap** or sit across
an **architectural seam**. Coupled work stays one Story — `## Slicing`
checkpoints, not sibling tickets ([ref](helpers/plan-reference.md)).

## Procedure

### 1. Interrogate

```bash
node .agents/scripts/plan-context.js --seed "<seed>" \
  --out temp/plan-<slug>/plan-context.json
# or: --seed-file <path> | --tickets 123,456 | --amends #<id>
```

**Always pass `--out`.** Persist auto-discovers the envelope from `--plan-dir`
and derives source ids from its `sourceTickets[]`; it also writes
**`stories.template.json`**, step 2's skeleton.

The envelope carries docs context, the story-author prompt, `sourceTickets[]`,
`duplicates[]` (open **Stories**, never Epics), `epicCandidates[]` +
`dependencyCandidates[]` (Gate #3; path collisions) and advisory
`complexitySignals` (**no routing authority**). A trivial scope can claim the
lite route at persist — shape-validated, failing closed to `full`
([ref](helpers/plan-reference.md)).

**Triage each unknown by resolver** ([ref](helpers/plan-reference.md)): an
**AFK** unknown (research settles it) is resolved before authoring, never
assumed; a **HITL** unknown goes to Gate #1. Under `--yes` do not ask free-form
operator questions — AFK unknowns are still researched; only HITL unknowns land
in Key Assumptions, each a decision-made-by-default.

**Gate #1** — STOP to confirm the sharpened plan intent and any
duplicate-candidate review. Under `--yes`, auto-proceed.

On a truthy `memoryPoolAdvisory.recommend`, name
[`/memory-consolidate`](memory-consolidate.md) quoting its `reasons[]`;
advisory.

On a truthy `deliverLightSuggestion.suggested`, offer — advisory, never an
automatic reroute — to deliver the seed instead; on confirm route **in this
session** into [`helpers/deliver-light.md`](helpers/deliver-light.md), its gate
filled from this envelope. A truthy `complexitySignals.uiSurface` names
[`/prototype`](prototype.md); never invoke it here.
[Both](helpers/plan-reference.md).

### 2. Author

**One-shot authoring.** From `stories.template.json`, author `stories.json`
in one pass. `body` is markdown **or** a structured object;
persist parses either, serializes canonical markdown and syncs top-level
`acceptance[]` / `verify[]` in — never dual-author them.

**Grounding = your reads + Phase 8.** Nothing inventories the repo: read each
file you cite; persist hard-errors on any `{path, assumption}` absent from the
tree. Fields: [ref](helpers/plan-reference.md).

Artifacts under `temp/plan-<slug>/`: `stories.json` (**length 1 by default**;
over-budget Specs fail closed — split or tighten, never under `docs/`); optional
`techspec.md` (**N===1 only**, folded into `## Spec`) and
`acceptance-manifest.json` (N>1 — `--plan-acceptance`). Use the envelope
`systemPrompts.story`; split only under the policy above.

**Tickets mode:** every Story authors a top-level `supersedes[]`; persist
refuses a partial map ([shape](helpers/plan-reference.md)).

### 2.5 Critics

```bash
node .agents/scripts/plan-critics.js \
  --stories temp/plan-<slug>/stories.json \
  [--tech-spec temp/plan-<slug>/techspec.md]
```

Run **before** persist — the last point a finding folds into a re-author. It
exits 0 on **any** verdict (verdicts route work, they do not gate) and exits
**1** only on a usage/IO error — no critic ran: **do not proceed to Persist**,
fix and re-run.

- **Both `dispatch: false`** — proceed to Persist (each skip is ledgered).
- **Either `dispatch: true`** — dispatch **one fresh-context, maker-blind
  sub-agent per firing critic** (hand it only the draft artifacts, never the
  authoring transcript), fold findings into Gate #2 or a re-author round, re-run
  this step. Pre-mortem triggers (incl. the external-dependency probe), the
  advisory-only `textHygiene.findings[]` lints and dispatch shape:
  [reference](helpers/plan-reference.md).

### 3. Persist

**Gate #2** — STOP for approval before persist **only** when the operator asked
to review (`--force-review`). Under `--yes`, auto-proceed.

**Gate #3 — adopt, else create.** Offer the top `epicCandidates[]` Epic at
**any N** (`--epic <id>`); else, at **N>2**, a new container (`--epic-title` /
`--epic-goal`). Never unasked ([ref](helpers/plan-reference.md)).

Run persist `--dry-run` **first** — same command, writes suppressed; every gate
runs before the first `createIssue` ([list](helpers/plan-reference.md)):

```bash
node .agents/scripts/plan-persist.js \
  --stories temp/plan-<slug>/stories.json \
  --plan-dir temp/plan-<slug> \
  [--plan-acceptance temp/plan-<slug>/acceptance-manifest.json] \
  [--tech-spec temp/plan-<slug>/techspec.md] \
  [--source-tickets 123,456] \
  [--epic <id> | --epic-title "<name>" --epic-goal "<one paragraph>"]
```

At lite shape `--chain-on-clean` folds a clean dry-run into the persist; a full
plan keeps its review trip.

Persist creates `type::story` issue(s), a **metadata-only** `plan-run::<id>`
label, `blocked by #<id>` footers for every `depends_on` edge, and on a Gate #3
yes links them under a `type::epic` container (adopted or new). `agent::ready`
is the **terminal** flip after receipts land; stdout is pure JSON. Tickets mode
also comments on and closes each source id ([ref](helpers/plan-reference.md)).

## Constraints

- `/mandrel-plan` starts delivery **only** through a confirmed Gate #1 light
  route — never off its Stories, which land via
  [`/mandrel-deliver`](mandrel-deliver.md).
- Duplicate search targets open Stories (`type::story`), not Epics; and
  deterministic gates still fail closed under `--yes`.
- A container Epic is never a work item and only an **open** one is adoptable;
  no Story body gains an `Epic: #N` footer (linkage is parent→child only).
- `depends_on` takes a sibling slug or `#<id>` (open Story).
