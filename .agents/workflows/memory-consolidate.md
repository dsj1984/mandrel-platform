# /memory-consolidate [--dry-run]

Agent memory drifts as the codebase moves: a workaround gets fixed, a budget
changes, two sessions save the same lesson twice. This is the sweep that
corrects it — and the **only** sanctioned writer of the memory pool outside a
session's own point-of-write corrections.

**Attended by contract.** Mandrel ships the trigger, the grounding and the
receipt; it never mutates the operator's personal memory store unsupervised.
Nothing here runs on a schedule, and no step deletes a file before Gate #2.

## Step 0 — Resolve the pool

`MANDREL_MEMORY_DIR` wins outright; otherwise the pool is
`~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/memory/`, where `<cwd-slug>` is the absolute
working directory with every `/` and `.` replaced by `-`.

Report the resolved path and the entry count. **No pool → say so in one line
and stop** — an absent substrate is a clean no-op, never an error, and never a
reason to create one.

Each project (and each worktree) has its own pool: consolidate the pool of the
checkout you are in, and never reach across into another.

## Step 1 — Read the pool

Read `MEMORY.md` and every `*.md` entry. Group them by subject so duplicates
and supersessions surface together. Do not judge an entry from its index line —
the index is a pointer, the file is the claim.

## Step 2 — Classify each entry

Verify before you keep. Run `ls` / `grep` against the **current tree** for the
paths, flags, budgets and gate names an entry cites; re-measure a number rather
than trusting it (`wc -c` a file whose byte budget is quoted).

| Verdict | Means | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fresh` | Claims re-confirmed against the tree | Leave byte-identical |
| `correct` | Core lesson holds, a detail has moved | Rewrite the detail in place, keep the entry |
| `duplicate` | Same lesson as another entry | Merge into the richer one, propose the thinner for pruning |
| `superseded` | The thing it warns about is fixed or retired | Strike the claim, keep the correction visible |
| `dead` | Subject no longer exists at all | Propose for pruning |

**A closed issue is the subject of a retrospective, never evidence of
staleness.** These pools are largely delivery write-ups — "delivered this
Story", "fixed by that PR". The referenced issue being closed is what the
memory is *about*: the normal, healthy shape. A retired predecessor of this
workflow marked exactly that pattern stale, which is why it no longer exists.
Use `github.owner` / `github.repo` from `.agentrc.json` when an issue
genuinely needs probing, and treat an unreachable probe as unknown — never
as dead.

Prefer `correct` over `dead`. A rewritten entry keeps hard-won context; a
deleted one costs a future session the same mistake.

## Step 3 — Gate #1: present the plan

Write the full proposal to `temp/memory/consolidation-<date>.md` — per entry:
verdict, evidence, and the exact edit or merge proposed. Summarize inline:
counts per verdict and the specific prune candidates by name.

**STOP.** Do not edit until the operator responds.

## Step 4 — Apply the edits

On confirmation, apply the `correct`, `duplicate` and `superseded` rewrites.
Preserve each entry's frontmatter contract (`name`, `description`, `metadata`)
and keep `[[wiki-link]]` references resolvable — a merge that orphans a link
has moved the problem, not fixed it.

## Step 5 — Gate #2: confirm every deletion

**Deletion is never implied by Gate #1.** Name each file proposed for pruning
with its one-line reason, and offer **mark-vs-delete**: marking the claim
superseded in place is the default and always available. Wait for an explicit
yes; delete only what the operator names. Silence is not consent.

## Step 6 — Rewrite the index and stamp

Rewrite `MEMORY.md` so it holds exactly one pointer line per surviving entry —
title, link, hook. It is loaded into context every session, so it carries
pointers only, never memory content.

Then write the receipt to `.consolidation-stamp.json` in the pool root:

```json
{ "lastConsolidatedAt": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>" }
```

The `/mandrel-plan` Phase 0 advisory reads this file; until it is written, the nudge
keeps firing. Write it **only** after Gate #2 — the stamp asserts an operator
reviewed the pass, so writing it early makes it a lie.

Close with counts: entries read, corrected, merged, pruned, and the new total.

## Constraints

- `--dry-run` runs Steps 0–3 and stops: the report is written, nothing mutates.
- Never delete an entry the operator did not name. Never write the stamp on a
  dry run or a declined gate.
- Never invent memories here — this pass corrects and prunes what sessions
  wrote; new memories come from the sessions that learned them.
