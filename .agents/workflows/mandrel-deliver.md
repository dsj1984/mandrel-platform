## Role

One delivery door. `/mandrel-deliver` owns input resolution, sequencing and the
close-and-land tail; Stories are implemented via
[`helpers/deliver-story.md`](helpers/deliver-story.md).

The dependency graph is **discovered, not declared** — `resolve-stories.js`
reads it from live state, so you can deliver Stories **across plan runs and
over time**. `plan-run::<id>` is filter metadata, never a resolution input;
`route::lite` a body-derived hint only.

## Inputs

Classify what the operator typed **before** anything else, and say which shape
you read:

| Invocation | Shape | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/mandrel-deliver` | bare | List the open `agent::ready` Stories and ask which to deliver. Deliver nothing until answered. |
| `/mandrel-deliver 4712` | ids | One Story via `helpers/deliver-story.md`, **inline in this session** — no `story-worker` spawn. |
| `/mandrel-deliver 4712 4713 …` | ids | Resolve the set, sequence by the discovered graph via `stories-wave-tick.js`, dispatch sub-agents. |
| `/mandrel-deliver 4712 - 4716` | ids | A **range** — every id in the inclusive span. |
| `/mandrel-deliver add a --json flag to doctor` | prompt | Unplanned work: gate, author a receipt Story, land it — [`helpers/deliver-light.md`](helpers/deliver-light.md). |

**The discriminator is lexical and total.** An argument matching `^#?\d+$` is an
id, and `^#?\d+\s*[-–—]\s*#?\d+$` an inclusive **range** — pass one on as a
single unspaced token, never hand-expanded (reference § Ranges). Either shape
means ids; anything else means a prompt. A **mixed** invocation (ids *and*
prose) is a **hard error** — refuse it and ask which was meant. A ticket not
`type::story`, or carrying an `Epic: #N` footer, is a hard error too.

## Saying what you want

No flags to remember: state intent — *"…but I'll merge it myself"*, *"…one at
a time"* — and announce what you read. Phrasings and the flags they fill in:
reference § Intent phrases.

`--yes` is **runner-set, never operator-typed**: cron, `/loop` and headless
dispatch set it to mean *nobody is at the keyboard*, which fails the unplanned
path's over-scope stop closed to an envelope instead of a question. Never offer
it to an operator or add it to an attended run.

## Procedure

0. **Classify and announce.** Read the invocation per § Inputs and state the
   shape. A prompt leaves for
   [`helpers/deliver-light.md`](helpers/deliver-light.md); bare asks; ids go on.

1. **Resolve the set.** One command, one Story or many:
   `node .agents/scripts/resolve-stories.js --ids <id,id,...>`. It validates the
   set and shows what will run: read `stories[]`, `dag[]` and `done[]` to
   present the order in step 2, but do **not** thread them into step 3 — the
   tick re-resolves the graph every beat. It hard-errors (exit 1) on an id that
   is not a Story, carries an `Epic: #N` footer, or whose edges cannot be
   read — a missing gate would co-dispatch against an unlanded blocker.

2. **Confirm (N>1).** Present the order; wait unless `--yes`.

3. **Sequence.** Loop until the tick reports `epilogueDue: true`:

   ```bash
   node .agents/scripts/stories-wave-tick.js \
     --stories <id,id,...> --probe-live \
     --dispatched <every id you have dispatched so far>
   ```

   **Do not add `--concurrency` unless the operator explicitly asked for a
   per-run cap** — an explicit value wins over config, so a literal defeats a
   `.agentrc.local.json` override.

   Each beat re-probes live state to derive done / in-flight itself; you never
   compute them. `--dispatched` is the one thing you must supply — the
   append-only list of every id you spawned this run. Cross-run de-confliction
   via the assignee lease is automatic (reference §§ Sequencing edge cases,
   Dispatch mechanics). Branch on the exit code:
   - **0** — dispatch each `ready` id (already capped and overlap-free); an
     empty `ready` with work in flight means "waiting", so keep looping;
     `epilogueDue: true` means every Story is done — step 4.
   - **2 / 3 / 4** — `cycleError` / `wedged` / `blocked`: stop the loop and
     route per reference § Sequencing edge cases. **4** is the protocol's HITL
     pause ([`instructions.md` § 1.J](../instructions.md)) — surface it and
     wait for the operator; never poll.

4. **Close each hand-off** (§ Closing what the workers hand back), then, with
   every Story landed, run the **per-run epilogue (N>1)**:
   `node .agents/scripts/plan-run-epilogue.js --stories 101,102`. N=1 skips it
   ([reference § Per-run epilogue](helpers/deliver-reference.md)).

5. **Correct what the change invalidated.** If a memory you recalled this
   session is now wrong — a trap this landed, a budget it moved — fix that
   entry now, while both the old belief and the new fact are in context, and
   say so when you report. No memory substrate → skip silently. Sweeping the
   whole pool is [`/memory-consolidate`](memory-consolidate.md), not this step.

## Closing what the workers hand back {#tail}

**The tail is the orchestrator's, not the worker's.** A dispatched
`story-worker` stops at a pushed branch and returns a hand-off; **you** run
[`helpers/deliver-story.md`](helpers/deliver-story.md) Step 3
(`single-story-close.js`) for it, foreground, and relay the envelope.

**Serialize the tail.** Implementation runs in parallel; closing does not. Close
one Story at a time — closes contend on the base branch, the merge queue and
the checkout. A worker handing back mid-close waits its turn.

**A worker returning no terminal envelope is the expected shape**, not a failure
to answer with a re-dispatch: only close mints one. Close the pushed branch, or
probe read-only with `node .agents/scripts/deliver-recover.js --story <storyId>`
and resume the worker or close it names.

**Reading the outcome.** Each close ends the Story in one schema-validated
envelope — `landed` | `pending` | `blocked` | `failed`; statuses, exits and
fields are digest § 5. `pending` is **not** a failure — `nextCommand` resumes
it; run that, do not re-dispatch.

**Branch model (authoritative).** `story-<id>` → PR → `main` (squash +
required checks), per digest § 2; dependent Stories land sequentially. Ceremony
depth (profiles + derived level via `ceremony-routing.js`, review depth reading
it): reference § Ceremony.

## Constraints

- **Land or block — never a silent local build** (digest § 2). Attended delivers
  default to close-and-land (`delivery.routing.closeAndLand: true`); rest at
  `agent::closing` only when a human owns it.
- **`/mandrel-deliver` never plans.** Planned tickets come from [`/mandrel-plan`](mandrel-plan.md), and
  an over-scope prompt **escalates and ends** — never invoke `/mandrel-plan` in this
  session to rescue it ([`helpers/deliver-light.md`](helpers/deliver-light.md)
  § Escalation is terminal).
