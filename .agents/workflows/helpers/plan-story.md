# helpers/plan-story — standalone-Story planning path (invoked by /plan)

## Overview

`/plan` is the standalone counterpart to
[`/plan`](plan-epic.md) for Stories that are **not** attached to an
Epic. It closes the gap between "one-line idea" and "well-formed
standalone Story body ready for [`/single-story-deliver`](single-story-deliver.md)"
using the same `host LLM authors + Node wrapper persists` split as
`/plan`.

```text
/plan --idea "<seed>"
  → story-plan.js --emit-context               (envelope: seed, template, dup candidates)
  → host LLM authors a draft Story body         (in chat, using the envelope)
  → operator confirms (HITL)
  → story-plan.js --body <file>                 (validate, gh issue create)
  → "Next: /deliver <id>"
```

**The two paths of `/plan` — when each applies:**

| Trait                | Standalone-Story path (this helper)        | Epic decomposition path (`helpers/plan-epic.md`) |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Output               | One standalone Story Issue                 | Epic with child Stories                      |
| Parent Epic          | None (no `Epic: #N` in body)               | Required                                     |
| Downstream workflow  | `/deliver <storyId>`                       | `/deliver <epicId>`                          |
| Replan surface       | Out of scope (recreate manually if needed) | `/plan <epicId> --force` regenerates the backlog |
| Inbound route        | `--idea` with a `story` triage verdict, `--body`, **or** a scope-triage handoff from the Epic path | Direct (`<epicId>`, or `--idea` with an `epic` verdict) |
| Outbound route       | Phase 2 may **escalate** an epic-sized draft to the Epic path (internal branch switch) | The story-sized advisory may **convert** a one-Story Epic to this path |

If a Story-under-Epic needs replanning, use `/plan <epicId> --force`. If you
have a refactor, framework-maintenance idea, or any standalone unit of
work, use this workflow.

**Inbound from `/plan` scope triage.** `/plan` Phase 1.5 runs the
[`core/scope-triage`](../../skills/core/scope-triage/SKILL.md) rubric over the
sharpened one-pager. On a `story` / `borderline` verdict the operator may route
the work here via `/plan --from-notes <path>`. That invocation is a
**scope-triage handoff** — the triage decision is already made, so `/plan`
MUST NOT re-triage it (the no-re-triage rule in the skill); it proceeds straight
to authoring the standalone Story body from the handed-off one-pager.

## Prerequisites

1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `gh auth status` clean — `gh issue create` runs at
   persist time.
2. The `type::story` label and the chosen `persona::*` label exist in the
   repo. Run [`agents-bootstrap-github.js`](../../scripts/agents-bootstrap-github.js)
   once to provision them.

## Invocation shapes

```bash
# Seed from an inline string:
/plan --idea "rip out the unused TaskBodyMigrator export"

# Seed from a notes file:
/plan --from-notes temp/single-story-2293-notes.md

# Inspect the draft body without creating an Issue:
/plan --dry-run --body temp/single-story-draft.md

# Headless / non-interactive (auto-proceeds the draft-confirm gate):
/plan --idea "rip out the unused TaskBodyMigrator export" --yes
```

## Phase 1 — Emit Context

Run the emit-context phase. The CLI prints a JSON envelope on stdout and
routes all log lines to stderr so the captured file is unconditionally
parseable by `JSON.parse`.

```bash
node .agents/scripts/story-plan.js --emit-context \
  --idea "<seed>" \
  [--persona engineer] \
  [--refine | --no-refine] \
  [--pretty] > temp/single-story-context.json
```

Envelope fields (`kind: "story-plan-context"`, `version: 1`):

| Field                  | Purpose                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `seed`                 | The raw seed (verbatim from `--idea` / `--from-notes`).   |
| `refine`               | `{ refine, reason }` heuristic verdict.                   |
| `persona`              | Persona label to apply (default `engineer`).              |
| `bodyTemplate`         | Contents of `.agents/templates/single-story-body.md`.     |
| `requiredSections`     | `["Context", "Acceptance Criteria", "Out of Scope", "Notes"]`. |
| `duplicateCandidates`  | Ranked open Stories whose titles fuzzy-match the seed.    |
| `techStack`            | The project's Tech Stack inventory, resolved in order: `docs/tech-stack.md` (full body) when present, else the `## Tech Stack` section of `docs/architecture.md` (numbered/decorated and final-section headings tolerated). |
| `deliverContract`      | Workflow path + required/forbidden labels and references. |

### Refine heuristic

`refine.refine` is `true` when the seed is shorter than 200 characters
(or empty). Pass `--refine` / `--no-refine` to override. When the
envelope advises refinement, activate the
[`core/idea-refinement`](../../skills/core/idea-refinement/SKILL.md) skill
before drafting the body — same skill `/plan` Phase 1 drives.

## Phase 2 — Host LLM Authors a Draft Body

Using the envelope above, draft a Story body that:

- Starts with `# <title>` (the H1 becomes the GitHub Issue title at
  persist time).
- Includes every section in `requiredSections` (`## Context`,
  `## Acceptance Criteria`, `## Out of Scope`, `## Notes`).
- Has at least one unchecked checklist item under `## Acceptance Criteria`
  (`- [ ] …`).
- Does **NOT** contain any `Epic: #N` reference — that breaks the
  standalone contract enforced by `single-story-init.js`.

Write the draft to `temp/single-story-draft.md`.

### Scope-triage escalation gate (symmetric counterpart to `/plan` Phase 1.5)

This gate runs the shared scope-triage gate over the **drafted Story body** to
catch an Epic-sized scope before it is persisted as a standalone Story — the
outbound mirror of `/plan` Phase 1.5's inbound downgrade gate. The gate
mechanics (verdict meanings, the three-way operator choice, the `--yes`
resolution, and the no-re-triage rule) live in the single-homed fragment
[`scope-triage-gate.md`](scope-triage-gate.md); read it and follow it. This
phase supplies only its path-specific firing conditions:

- **When it runs**: only **after the draft body exists** — the seed alone is
  not an honest basis for a sizing judgment. The rubric is applied to the
  **drafted Story body**, and the verdict folds into the **existing**
  draft-confirmation HITL stop below (it does **not** add a second stop). (The
  `refine` heuristic in `story-plan.js` is unchanged — it is a deterministic
  seed-length proxy, not a scope-size judgment.)
- **When it is skipped**: entirely, when `/plan` was entered via a scope-triage
  handoff — from `/plan` Phase 1.5 (the inbound route above) or the `/plan`
  Phase 5.5 existing-Epic conversion path (the no-re-triage rule in the
  fragment).
- **Recommended branch on an `epic` verdict**: escalate to `/plan --idea` —
  persist the notes/draft to a notes file and hand off to `/plan --idea` (or
  `--from-notes <path>`), identifying the invocation as a scope-triage handoff
  so `/plan` skips its own Phase 1.5 gate, then **abandon the draft and exit
  `/plan`** (no standalone Story is created). The alternative branches are
  **persist as a standalone Story anyway** (proceed to Phase 3 with the draft
  unchanged) and **abort**.

### HITL — operator confirms the draft (verdict folded in)

Display the draft to the operator and **STOP**. Do not call the persist phase
until the operator explicitly confirms the draft. This mirrors the HITL gate
`/plan` Phase 3 enforces before opening the Epic Issue. This is the
story-path face of `/plan`'s **gate #1** (the ideation one-pager /
scope-triage confirm). The scope-triage verdict folds into this same stop, per
the branch bindings above; on a **`story` verdict (or gate skipped via
handoff)** there is no extra prompt and the operator confirms the draft as
usual. The `--yes` headless resolution of this stop is the fragment's — see
[`scope-triage-gate.md` § `--yes` (headless) resolution](scope-triage-gate.md#--yes-headless-resolution)
and [`plan.md` § Headless / non-interactive mode](../plan.md#headless--non-interactive-mode---yes).

## Phase 3 — Persist (`gh issue create`)

```bash
node .agents/scripts/story-plan.js \
  --body temp/single-story-draft.md \
  [--persona engineer]
```

The script:

1. Reads the body file.
2. Runs `validateStoryBody` — required sections present, no `Epic:`
   reference, AC checklist non-empty. Fails fast on any error.
3. Extracts the H1 title.
4. Calls `gh issue create` with `--title`, `--body-file`, and the
   `type::story` + `persona::<name>` labels.
5. Prints a JSON line with `{ issueNumber, title, labels }` and a
   trailing `Next: /single-story-deliver <id>` hint on stderr.

### `--dry-run`

```bash
node .agents/scripts/story-plan.js \
  --body temp/single-story-draft.md --dry-run
```

Prints the resolved title, labels, and `gh` argv plus the full body, then
exits 0. No GitHub mutations. Use this to spot-check the draft and the
exact `gh issue create` shape that would run.

## Constraints

- **No `Epic: #N` references.** This is the standalone contract; persist
  fails fast if one is present. To attach a Story to an Epic, use
  `/plan` Phase 8 instead.
- **No external LLM APIs.** Mirrors the v5.6 contract: the host LLM does
  the authoring; the Node wrapper does the I/O.
- **Idempotent.** Re-running `--emit-context` is safe. Re-running
  `--body` opens a new Issue (it is not aware of prior runs); use
  `--dry-run` first when iterating on the draft.
- **Atomic by contract.** A Story is the leaf of the 2-tier hierarchy — it
  has no child tickets. Its acceptance criteria and verification steps live
  inline on the Story body
  ([`single-story-deliver.md`](single-story-deliver.md)).
