# /single-story-deliver #[Story ID]

## Overview

`/single-story-deliver` is the standalone counterpart to
[`/deliver`](deliver-stories.md). Use it for a Story that is **not**
attached to an Epic — refactors carved out of closed Epics, framework
maintenance, or any work small enough that the Epic-Centric ceremony
(PRD + Tech Spec + decomposition + dispatch manifest + cascade) would be
overhead rather than help.

```text
/single-story-deliver <storyId>
  → single-story-init.js          (branch from main, worktree, agent::executing)
  → agent implements + commits     (operator works in the worktree)
  → single-story-close.js          (gates, push, gh pr create → main, agent::closing)
  → CI watch + fix loop            (until all required checks pass + PR is merged)
  → single-story-confirm-merge.js  (PR merged → agent::done, issue closes)
```

**When to use `/single-story-deliver` vs. `/deliver`:**

| Trait                         | `/single-story-deliver`                              | `/deliver`                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parent Epic                   | None (no `Epic: #N` in body)                         | Required (`Epic: #N` in body)                           |
| Branch base                   | `project.baseBranch` (default `main`)          | `epic/<epicId>`                                         |
| Merge target                  | `main` via PR                                        | `epic/<epicId>` via `--no-ff` merge                     |
| Epic-branch integration       | No                                                   | Yes — merged into `epic/<epicId>` at close              |
| Dispatch manifest interaction | None                                                 | Read at init, regenerated at close                      |
| Story scope                   | Inline `acceptance[]` / `verify[]` on the Story body | Inline `acceptance[]` / `verify[]` on the Story body    |

If the Story has an `Epic: #N` reference, use `/deliver`. If it
doesn't, use this workflow (or `/deliver` for several standalone
Stories at once).

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub Issue with the `type::story` label and **no** `Epic: #N`
   reference in its body.
2. `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `gh auth status` clean — `gh pr create` runs at close.
3. The base branch (`project.baseBranch`, default `main`) exists on
   both local and `origin`.

---

## Step 0 — Initialize (`single-story-init.js`)

Run from the **main checkout** (the worktree does not exist yet):

```bash
node .agents/scripts/single-story-init.js --story <storyId>
```

Flags: `--dry-run` (no git/ticket mutation), `--steal` (forcibly transfer a
foreign Story lease to this operator — see the fail-closed lease note below).

> **Execution mode.** Like `story-init.js`, this command can take 3–6
> minutes when the worktree's per-tree install runs. Invoke synchronously
> with `Bash(timeout: 600000)`. Do **not** use `run_in_background` +
> `Monitor` — a sub-agent that exits mid-install leaves the worktree
> half-bootstrapped.

The script validates `type::story`, **acquires the Story lease**, fetches
`origin`, seeds `story-<id>` from `baseBranch`, materializes a worktree
(when `delivery.worktreeIsolation.enabled` is true), upserts a
`story-init` structured comment carrying `standalone: true`, and flips
the Story to `agent::executing`.

> **Lease preflight (Story #3483).** Before any git mutation, init takes an
> exclusive, time-bounded **lease** on the Story ticket via the
> assignee-as-lease primitive (`lib/orchestration/ticket-lease.js`). The
> single assignee *is* the lease owner (resolved from
> `github.operatorHandle`). The standalone path has no Epic-scoped dispatch
> manifest to serialise two operators driving the same Story, so this lease
> is the only guard against a concurrent `single-story-init` clobbering an
> in-flight run.
>
> **Fail-closed (audit #3513).** Unlike `/deliver`, the standalone path
> has **no Epic-scoped lifecycle ledger** to read a per-owner
> `story.heartbeat` from, so there is no live-heartbeat source to decide
> whether a foreign claim is stale. Rather than silently reclaim every
> foreign assignee (which would leave the guard inert), the standalone lease
> **fails closed**: a foreign assignee is treated as a *live* claim. Outcomes:
>
> - **Unclaimed / self-held** → init proceeds (a self-held claim is
>   re-affirmed without re-writing assignees).
> - **Any foreign assignee** → init **exits non-zero** with a message naming
>   the current owner. Coordinate with that operator, or pass **`--steal`** to
>   forcibly transfer the claim once you have confirmed the other run is dead.
>
> `--dry-run` skips the lease (no assignee mutation). The matching release
> runs in `single-story-close.js` (Step 3).

Init is also idempotent on the Story branch itself:

> **Branch reuse (Story #3483).** When a `story-<id>` branch already exists
> locally, init **reuses** it rather than re-creating it (re-running
> `git branch` on an existing ref throws `branch already exists`). The
> seed decision (`reuse` / `fetch` / `create`) keys off local + remote ref
> presence, so re-running init on a partially-initialized Story is
> idempotent.

Between the fetch and the branch-seed step, the script also runs a
**merged-`story-*` sweep**: it invokes the same primitive as
`<agentRoot>/scripts/git-cleanup.js` (`<agentRoot>` resolves
from `project.paths.agentRoot`, default `.agents`) scoped to `story-*`
only, in `--execute --remote` mode, with the current run's
`story-<id>` branch excluded from the candidate list. Local refs, the
matching `origin/` ref, and stale tracking refs for any merged sibling
stories are reaped in one pass. The sweep never blocks init — failures
are logged and the new story is initialized regardless.

The sweep applies two hardening layers (Story #2011):

- **Per-candidate protection.** Each merged-PR candidate is filtered
  through three guards before reaching `executeCleanup`:
  - `unpushed-work` — branch HEAD SHA differs from the PR's
    `headRefOid`, meaning the operator has commits the merge didn't
    capture.
  - `dirty-tree` — the attached worktree (if any) has uncommitted
    changes.
  - `ticket-not-done` — the parent Story ticket isn't closed and
    doesn't carry `agent::done`.
  Protected candidates are skipped, listed in the sweep result envelope
  under `protected[]`, and named in the `CLEANUP` log line so the
  operator can see what was preserved.
- **Cross-session lock.** The sweep acquires a process-scoped lockfile
  at `<tempRoot>/single-story-sweep.lock` before planning. On
  contention (another `/single-story-deliver` already in the sweep
  step), this run's sweep is **skipped** with a warn log; init
  continues normally. Stale lockfiles (mtime older than the timeout)
  are treated as expired. The timeout defaults to 60 seconds and is
  overridable via `delivery.worktreeIsolation.sweepLockMs` in
  `.agentrc.json`.

Both layers are non-fatal — sweep failure / skip never blocks init, and
the new story is always created.

Capture `workCwd` from the result envelope. Add `--dry-run` to inspect
the planned actions without git or ticket mutations (dry-run also skips
the sweep).

### Step 0.5 — `cd` into the workCwd

```bash
cd "<workCwd from Step 0 result>"
```

All subsequent commands run from this directory.

> **Worktree scope is not just the Bash cwd.** `cd <workCwd>` steers the
> **Bash** tool's working directory, but it does **not** scope the
> path-based **Edit/Write/Read** tools — those resolve **absolute paths**
> and ignore the shell cwd. On Windows especially, an agent whose shell
> sits in the worktree can still silently edit the **main checkout** if it
> resolves a main-checkout absolute path. To stay in the worktree you MUST
> prefix **every Edit/Write/Read path with the absolute worktree root**
> (the `workCwd` value from Step 0), not merely `cd` into it. Never edit
> files under the bare main-checkout root. `single-story-close.js` runs a
> **wrong-tree guard** (Story #3364) that aborts close and posts a
> `friction` comment if it finds uncommitted tracked-path edits in the main
> checkout while the worktree is the active work tree — but that is a
> backstop, not a substitute for prefixing paths correctly.

---

## Step 1 — Implementation

A standalone Story is **atomic** — no wave dispatch and no Epic-scoped
cascade. Work happens in one or more commits on the `story-<id>`
branch, against the inline `acceptance[]` / `verify[]` arrays on the
Story body.

Operator/agent responsibilities while in the worktree:

1. Read the Story body. Treat its acceptance criteria as the contract.
2. Implement the changes.
3. Commit on the Story branch. Conventional-commit format is encouraged
   but not enforced — the PR title carries the canonical summary.
4. Iterate (read tests, run targeted gates, edit, commit) until the
   acceptance criteria are met.
5. Run the **bounded acceptance self-eval loop** (Step 1a below) before
   proceeding to close.

Recommended quick gates while iterating (each is fast enough to run on
save):

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test -- --grep "<scope>"
```

The full close-validation chain runs in Step 3; the gates above are
advisory pre-flight.

> Conflict with `main` mid-implementation → resolve as you would any
> branch rebase. There is no `epic/<id>` intermediate, so the rebase
> base is `main` directly.

### Step 1a — Bounded acceptance self-eval loop (**required, not optional**)

After the implementation commits land and **before** you proceed to close, run
the bounded acceptance self-eval loop. The per-round critic mechanic (fresh-
context critic, `verify[]`-as-evidence, the verdict schema, and the
proceed / redraft / block decision) is the single-homed include
[`acceptance-self-eval.md`](acceptance-self-eval.md) — read it and follow it.

Standalone specifics for this path:

- **Critic evidence-share** (Story #4250). When the critic runs a `verify[]`
  command that is byte-identical to a close gate (`lint` / `typecheck`), it
  records the pass into the standalone evidence keyspace via `--standalone`
  (no parent Epic to key on) so Step 3's close short-circuits the gate at
  unchanged HEAD. Run it in the **Story worktree** (`workCwd` from Step 0):

  ```bash
  node <main-repo>/.agents/scripts/evidence-gate.js \
    --standalone --scope-id <storyId> --gate lint \
    --worktree <workCwd> -- npm run lint
  ```

- **Gate invocation** (omit `--epic` — there is no parent Epic):

  ```bash
  node <main-repo>/.agents/scripts/acceptance-eval.js \
    --story <storyId> --verdict <verdict-path>
  ```

- **On `decision: "proceed"`** → proceed to Step 3 (close).
- **On `decision: "block"`** → **do not proceed to close.** Post a `friction`
  comment naming the unmet criteria, then transition the Story to
  `agent::blocked`:

  ```bash
  node .agents/scripts/diagnose-friction.js --story <storyId> \
    --cmd node .agents/scripts/acceptance-eval.js --story <storyId> --verdict <verdict-path>
  node .agents/scripts/update-ticket-state.js --ticket <storyId> --state agent::blocked
  ```

---

## Step 2 — Validate (deferred to close)

`single-story-close.js` runs the canonical close-validation chain
(typecheck, lint, test, format, maintainability, coverage, crap) before
it pushes. Do **not** pre-run those gates here unless interactively
iterating on a fix.

---

## Step 3 — Close (`single-story-close.js`)

Invoke from the main checkout (or pass `--cwd <main-repo>` from inside
the worktree):

```bash
node <main-repo>/.agents/scripts/single-story-close.js --story <storyId> --cwd <main-repo>
```

The script:

1. Runs the close-validation gates against `baseBranch` as the baseline.
   On any gate failure it throws — the operator fixes and re-runs close.
1a. **Syncs the Story branch from `origin/<baseBranch>`** before push
   (Story #2580). Runs `git fetch origin <baseBranch>` followed by
   `git merge --no-edit origin/<baseBranch>` inside the worktree. This
   defends against the parallel-`/single-story-deliver` race: when
   multiple sessions run in parallel, the Story that auto-merges first
   bumps `baseBranch`, and without this sync the lagging Stories open
   PRs that are "behind base" and stall against branch-protection's
   `up-to-date branch` rule. Outcomes:
   - **No-op / fast-forward / clean merge-commit** → close proceeds to
     push.
   - **Merge conflict** → the merge is aborted, a `friction` structured
     comment is posted on the Story (conflicting file list + recovery
     command set), the Story flips to `agent::blocked`, and close
     throws. Resolve in the worktree (`git merge origin/<base>` + fix
     conflicts + `git commit --no-edit`) and re-run
     `/single-story-deliver`.
   - **Fetch failed** → close throws with the git stderr; no label
     transition.

   Note: the merge queue (when enabled) re-tests each PR against the
   queue tip before merging, so this sync + merge queue is the complete
   defence against the parallel race. Without merge queue, the sync
   closes the PR-open-time race but a residual race remains between PR
   open and auto-merge fire.
2. Pushes `story-<id>` to `origin`.
3. Probes for an existing open PR with `head = story-<id>`. If none
   exists, opens one via `gh pr create --base <baseBranch>`. The PR
   body carries `Closes #<storyId>` so the GitHub merge auto-closes the
   issue.
3a. **Enables GitHub native auto-merge by default** via
   `gh pr merge <prNumber> --auto --squash --delete-branch`. Once CI's
   required checks turn green, GitHub squash-merges the PR and deletes
   the source branch — the operator does not need to babysit the merge
   button. Mirrors the `/deliver` finalize path. Failure is
   non-fatal: the operator retains the manual merge surface in the
   GitHub UI. Pass `--no-auto-merge` to opt out when the PR needs a
   pre-merge eyeball.
4. Flips the Story to **`agent::closing`** (NOT `agent::done`) and leaves
   the GitHub issue **OPEN** (Story #3385). Auto-merge completes
   asynchronously *after* this script exits, so closing the issue here
   would strand a CLOSED issue with no merged work if the PR later failed
   CI, went `BEHIND` base, or was closed without merging. The Story rests
   at `agent::closing` while the PR is open with auto-merge armed; the
   `agent::done` flip (which closes the issue) is deferred to Step 5.5's
   `single-story-confirm-merge.js`. This brings the standalone path to
   parity with the epic path (#2155), where a Story only reaches
   `agent::done` once its merge into `epic/<id>` is confirmed.
5. Reaps the worktree when `delivery.worktreeIsolation.reapOnSuccess`
   is enabled.
6. **Releases the Story lease** (Story #3483). Clears the Story assignment
   that init claimed so the next `/single-story-deliver` run sees an
   unclaimed ticket. The release is a no-op when the operator no longer
   holds the claim (a later run took over via reclaim/steal), so a late
   close never yanks a live claim away from its current owner. Best-effort:
   a release failure is logged but does not fail an otherwise-clean close —
   the lease goes stale via TTL regardless. The close result carries
   `leaseReleased: <boolean>`.

`--skip-validation` bypasses Step 1 (gates). Use only when re-running
close after a fixed gate failure that's already known to pass.

`--skip-sync` bypasses Step 1a (base-sync). Use only when re-running
close after a hand-resolved sync, or in tests.

`--no-auto-merge` disables Step 3a. Use when the PR materially changes
behaviour and warrants pre-merge review.

---

## Step 4 — CI watch + fix loop (**required, not optional**)

The Story is **not done** when `single-story-close.js` returns. Auto-merge
only fires when every required CI check turns green. Local close-validation
gates pass on the dev host's environment (Windows, particular Node patch,
particular concurrency), but CI runs on a different OS and concurrency —
coverage rounding, platform-conditional branches, and timing-sensitive
tests routinely drift between the two. The agent owns the green-CI
outcome, not just the push.

> **The auto-merge wait is an internally-blocking step, not a reason to end
> your turn.** This is the single most important contract of this workflow,
> and the seam where a worker most often misbehaves: it delivers up to arming
> auto-merge, then ends its turn with **free-form prose** — e.g. "I'll wait
> for the background watch task to complete" or "the next event will be its
> completion notification" — leaving the merge unconfirmed and the Story
> stranded at `agent::closing` (observed on Story #1553 / PR #1554). **Do not
> do this.** `gh pr checks <prNumber> --watch` *blocks the current turn* until
> CI resolves — that is the mechanism by which you wait. You MUST keep your
> turn alive across the wait: watch → (fix + push + re-watch on red) → confirm
> the merge (Step 5) → flip `agent::done` → run the post-merge steps → and
> only then return the terminal JSON status contract (Step 4 of
> [`deliver-stories.md` § 2c](deliver-stories.md), mirrored in
> [§ Return contract](#return-contract) for the standalone caller). The CI
> wait NEVER terminates your turn; **only** a confirmed-`MERGED` PR (→
> `status: "done"`), an `agent::blocked` transition (→ `status: "blocked"`),
> or an unrecoverable failure (→ `status: "failed"`) does. Ending your turn
> with prose and an unconfirmed merge is a contract violation — it is the very
> bug this workflow exists to prevent.

After `single-story-close.js` succeeds, enter the watch + fix loop:

```bash
gh pr checks <prNumber> --watch
```

When the watch exits:

- **All checks ✓** — auto-merge will fire (or has already). The Story is
  still at `agent::closing` with its issue OPEN at this point (Step 3
  deferred the `agent::done` flip). The `Closes #<id>` footer closes the
  Story issue when the merge lands; Step 5 confirms the merge and Step 5.5
  flips the Story to `agent::done`. **Proceed to Step 5 within the same
  turn** — do not end your turn here. Green CI is the *start* of the
  merge-confirm sequence, not a terminal state (see Step 7's no-park rule).
- **Any check ✗** — diagnose, fix, and push a new commit on
  `story-<storyId>`, then re-watch. Auto-merge stays enabled across
  retries; no need to re-arm it. The Story stays at `agent::closing`
  throughout, so a failed/abandoned PR never strands a CLOSED issue.

### Resurrecting the worktree after `reapOnSuccess`

`single-story-close.js` reaps the worktree on success when
`delivery.worktreeIsolation.reapOnSuccess` is enabled (the default). To
fix CI you must re-attach a worktree to the existing remote branch:

```bash
cd <main-repo>
git fetch origin story-<storyId>
git worktree add .worktrees/story-<storyId> story-<storyId>
cd .worktrees/story-<storyId>
```

Do **not** re-run `single-story-init.js` — it would reset the branch
state and lose the close commit's structured comment.

### Diagnosing the failure

Pull the failing job log via:

```bash
gh run view <runId> --repo <owner>/<repo> --log-failed
```

The `<runId>` is the run number that `gh pr checks` shows in the
failing row's URL. Read the bottom of the log — the gate that exited
non-zero is named there (e.g. `[Coverage] ❌ REGRESSION in …`).

### Fixing without re-running close-validation

For coverage / maintainability / CRAP regressions detected only on CI:

1. Update the relevant baseline file (`baselines/coverage.json`,
   `baselines/maintainability.json`, `baselines/crap.json`) to absorb
   CI's actual numbers. Edit by hand when CI's numbers are within the
   tolerance you'd otherwise accept — don't re-run `npm run … :update`
   locally, because Windows numbers will overwrite CI's Linux numbers
   and the cycle repeats.
2. Commit the baseline delta with a `chore(baselines):` message that
   names the CI run that produced the values.
3. `git push` to `origin/story-<storyId>` and re-watch.

For genuine test failures (a flaky test, a platform-conditional bug):
fix the code or test, commit, push, re-watch. Keep iterating until
the watch exits clean.

### When to stop iterating

- **Three consecutive failures with the same fix shape** — stop and
  Re-Plan per Anti-Thrashing Protocol. The diagnosis is likely wrong.
- **Operator-blocking failure** (security scanner, branch-protection
  rule the agent can't change) — transition the Story to
  `agent::blocked`, summarize the blocker on the PR, and yield to the
  operator.

### Idempotence of the loop

- The PR stays open across retries; `gh pr create` is a one-shot at
  close, the loop only pushes new commits.
- Auto-merge stays armed across retries — pushing a new commit does
  not disarm `gh pr merge --auto`.
- If the operator manually merges or disables auto-merge mid-loop,
  exit the loop and report.

---

## Step 5 — Merge confirmation + `agent::done` flip (**required, not optional**)

With auto-merge enabled (default), GitHub squash-merges the PR when
every required check turns green and the `Closes #<id>` footer
auto-closes the Story issue.

Confirm the merge landed:

```bash
gh pr view <prNumber> --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit
```

Expect `state: "MERGED"`. With `--no-auto-merge`, the PR is the merge
gate. The operator reviews and merges via the GitHub UI; the same
`Closes #<id>` auto-close fires when the merge lands on `main`.

**Then flip the Story to `agent::done`.** Step 3 deferred this flip
(Story #3385) so the Story rested at `agent::closing` with its issue OPEN
while the PR was open. Now that the merge is confirmed, drive the
`agent::closing → agent::done` transition (which closes the issue) via:

```bash
node .agents/scripts/single-story-confirm-merge.js --story <storyId> --cwd <main-repo>
```

The confirmation script re-reads the live PR state (`gh pr view --json
state,mergedAt`, probing `gh pr list --head story-<id> --state all` when
`--pr` is omitted) and:

- **PR `MERGED`** → flips `agent::closing → agent::done`, closing the
  issue, and fires the `story-merged` notify. Prints
  `{ action: 'done', merged: true, ... }`.
- **PR still open / closed-without-merge** → leaves the Story at
  `agent::closing` (issue stays OPEN) and prints
  `{ action: 'pending', reason: 'pr-open' | 'pr-not-merged' | 'no-pr' }`.
  Re-run after the merge lands.
- **Story already `agent::done` / issue already closed** → idempotent
  `{ action: 'noop', reason: 'already-done' }`.

This is the standalone counterpart to the epic path's post-merge
`agent::done` flip in `post-merge-close.js` (#2155): the issue closes
exactly when the work has merged, never at PR-open.

---

## Step 5.5 — Re-assert Status column (**required, not optional**)

The GitHub Projects v2 built-in workflows `Pull request merged` and
`Pull request linked to issue` are enabled by default on most boards
and fire ~minutes *after* auto-merge lands. They overwrite the Status
field as a side-effect, clobbering the `Done` value
`single-story-confirm-merge.js` set at the `agent::done` flip in Step 5
and leaving closed Stories stuck at `In Progress` on the board
(reproduced on Story #2813). The confirmation step has already exited by
then, so the bot gets the last write.

Re-assert authority once the merge confirms:

```bash
node .agents/scripts/resync-status-column.js --story <storyId>
```

What this does:

- Reads the ticket's current `agent::*` label set (now `agent::done`).
- Re-fires the same `ColumnSync` mutation `transitionTicketState` used
  at close, overwriting the bot's late write.
- **Polls the live Status for ~15 s after the initial write** and
  re-fires on drift (Story #2876). Without this loop, a one-shot
  mutation routinely lost the race against the bot's asynchronous
  fire (reproduced on Story #2871 / PR #2872).
- Prints a single-line JSON envelope:
  `{ ticketId, status, column?, reason?, attempts? }`. `attempts > 1`
  means the helper had to fight a bot overwrite; `status: 'drifted'`
  means the bot won every attempt in the poll budget (rare; usually
  signals operator should reap the conflicting workflows).

Tuning flags (rarely needed):

- `--poll-attempts <n>` — total mutation attempts including the
  initial sync. Default `4`. Pass `1` to disable the poll loop
  (fastest, matches pre-#2876 behaviour).
- `--poll-delay-ms <ms>` — delay between drift checks. Default `5000`.

Idempotent: re-running on a ticket whose Status already matches the
target returns the same envelope. No-op skips (`no-project`,
`no-meta`, `not-on-project`) exit 0 with the reason in the envelope
so the workflow can continue.

**Canonical operator fix:** run
`node .agents/scripts/agents-bootstrap-github.js --reap-conflicting-workflows`
once per project to delete the conflicting bot workflows entirely.
This eliminates the race source; the poll loop becomes pure
defense-in-depth against re-enabled or future workflows.

Skip Step 5.5 only when the operator opted out of auto-merge AND has
not yet merged the PR (no `agent::done` to re-assert yet) — run it
after the manual merge instead.

---

## Step 6 — Local branch cleanup (**required, not optional**)

GitHub deletes the **remote** branch on auto-merge (via the
`--delete-branch` flag `single-story-close.js` passes to `gh pr merge`).
The **local** `story-<storyId>` ref, however, lingers in the main
checkout until something prunes it — `single-story-init.js` runs a
merged-sweep at the start of every *subsequent* `/single-story-deliver`
invocation, but that's next-run cleanup, not end-of-run cleanup. Stale
local refs accumulate between sessions, clutter `git branch`, and shadow
the lessons the sweep is meant to surface.

**Why local `main` goes stale:** `single-story-init.js` seeds new
`story-<id>` branches from the **local** `baseBranch` ref (default
`main`). Auto-merge updates **`origin/main`** on GitHub; nothing in
close or the old Step 6 command updated **local `main`**. The next init
then forked from a tip six merges behind until you manually pulled.
`single-story-init` also attempts the same fast-forward after `git fetch`
when the main checkout is clean (defense in depth if Step 6 was skipped).
Step 6 must still run `--fast-forward-main` so local `main` is current
before the next session — init may skip when the tree is dirty or the
operator is mid-checkout on another branch.

After Step 5 confirms `state: "MERGED"`, prune the story ref **and**
fast-forward local `main` (or `project.baseBranch`):

```bash
node .agents/scripts/git-cleanup.js \
  --execute \
  --remote \
  --yes \
  --fast-forward-main \
  --branches \
  --include "story-<storyId>"
```

What this does:

- **`--fast-forward-main`** fetches `origin/<baseBranch>` and
  `git merge --ff-only` on the main checkout when the tree is clean and
  the local base is strictly behind remote. Skipped when already current,
  dirty, or diverged (see `/git-cleanup`).
- **`--branches`** reaps the merged `story-<storyId>` ref (worktree,
  local branch, stale `origin/` tracking ref). Does not run
  `--prune-remotes` or `--stashes` unless you add those flags.
- **`--include "story-<storyId>"`** scopes the branch reap to this
  Story's ref only — sibling stories in flight are untouched.
- **`--execute --remote --yes`** actually deletes the local ref, prunes
  the matching `origin/` tracking ref, and runs non-interactively.

The sweep is idempotent. It is safe to run before `state: "MERGED"`
confirms (it will skip a not-yet-merged branch), and safe to re-run
after a successful cleanup (it reports "no merged branches to clean
up").

Skip Step 6 only when the operator has explicitly opted out via
`--no-auto-merge` AND has not yet merged the PR — in that case, leave
the branch in place until the manual merge lands, then run the
cleanup.

## Step 7 — Return contract (**required when dispatched as a sub-agent**) {#return-contract}

When this workflow runs as a per-Story sub-agent (dispatched by `/deliver`
via [`deliver-stories.md` § 2a/2c](deliver-stories.md)), the **only**
acceptable way to end your turn is to **return a single terminal JSON status
object** — never free-form prose:

```json
{
  "storyId": <number>,
  "status": "done" | "blocked" | "failed",
  "phase": "init|implementing|closing|blocked|done",
  "branchDeleted": <boolean>,
  "blockerCommentId": <string|null>,
  "detail": "<one-liner: what changed + what was verified, e.g. PR #N merged>",
  "renderedBody": "<terminal Story body>"
}
```

This is the same envelope [`deliver-stories.md` § 2c](deliver-stories.md)
mandates; this section is its single-homed restatement for the standalone
worker so the contract is self-contained when this workflow is the entry
point.

**The auto-merge wait does not produce a fourth status.** There is no
"pending" or "waiting" terminal — the CI/auto-merge wait is handled
*internally* by blocking on `gh pr checks --watch` (Step 4) and confirming
the merge (Step 5). You return **only** when you have reached a genuinely
terminal state:

- **`status: "done"`** — the PR is confirmed `state: "MERGED"` (Step 5),
  the Story carries `agent::done`, and Steps 5.5 / 6 have run. `phase: "done"`,
  `branchDeleted: true`.
- **`status: "blocked"`** — you transitioned the Story to `agent::blocked`
  and posted a `friction` comment (acceptance self-eval block in Step 1a, a
  base-sync conflict, or an operator-blocking CI failure / Anti-Thrashing
  stop in Step 4). `phase: "blocked"`, `blockerCommentId` set.
- **`status: "failed"`** — an unrecoverable failure outside the blocked
  protocol. `phase` reflects where it died.

A turn that ends with prose ("I'll wait for the watch task…", "the next event
will be its completion notification…") and an **unconfirmed merge** is a
**contract violation** (the Story #1553 / PR #1554 failure mode): the parent
wave loop cannot distinguish "still working" from "done but silent", and the
Story strands at `agent::closing`. If you genuinely cannot confirm the merge,
that is a `blocked` or `failed` outcome with the JSON contract above — not a
prose hand-off.

## Idempotence

- `single-story-init.js` re-prints the same `workCwd` without recreating
  the worktree when one already exists for `story-<id>`.
- `single-story-close.js` short-circuits when the Story is already
  closed (returns `{ action: 'noop', reason: 'already-closed' }`).
- `single-story-confirm-merge.js` short-circuits when the Story already
  carries `agent::done` or the issue is already closed (returns
  `{ action: 'noop', reason: 'already-done' }`), and is safe to re-run
  while the PR is still open (returns `{ action: 'pending', ... }` without
  mutating the Story).
- The PR probe (`gh pr list --head <branch> --state open`) reuses an
  existing open PR rather than opening a duplicate.

Re-running `/single-story-deliver` against an already-closed Story is
safe.

---

## Constraints

- **Never** push the Story branch directly to `main`. The PR is the only
  merge surface.
- **Always** `cd` into the `workCwd` returned by Step 0 before editing,
  **and** prefix every path-based Edit/Write/Read with that absolute
  `workCwd` root — the `cd` alone does not scope the path-based tools (see
  Step 0.5). Editing a bare main-checkout path lands the change in the wrong
  tree; close's wrong-tree guard (Story #3364) aborts when it detects this.
- **Always** pass `--cwd <main-repo>` to `single-story-close.js` when
  invoking from inside a worktree (worktree-local branch deletion fails
  when run from inside the worktree).
- **Handoff discipline — report state, not process.** When you hand back to
  your caller (the `/deliver` aggregator or the interactive operator),
  report essential terminal state only: the Story branch, the closing commit
  SHA, what changed, and what was verified. Mirror the fields the close
  pipeline already emits (`single-story-close.js` / `story-phase.js`
  envelopes, the `story-run-progress` snapshot) rather than inventing a new
  contract. Do not narrate the steps you took, and do not prescribe how the
  next stage should do its work. Prose process commentary only bloats the
  hydrated prompt (`delivery.maxTokenBudget` elision).
- **Label transitions**: drive every `agent::*` state change through
  `node .agents/scripts/update-ticket-state.js --ticket <id> --state <state>`.
  This CLI is the authoritative mechanism — there is no separate
  state-mutation MCP server to degrade from (see
  [`.agents/instructions.md` § 1.D](../../instructions.md)).
