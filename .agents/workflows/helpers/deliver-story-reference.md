## Step 0 — Lease preflight and merged-sweep

### Lease preflight

Before any git mutation, init takes an exclusive, time-bounded **lease** on
the Story ticket via the assignee-as-lease primitive
(`lib/orchestration/ticket-lease.js`). The single assignee _is_ the lease
owner (resolved from `github.operatorHandle`). The standalone path has no
Epic-scoped dispatch manifest to serialise two operators driving the same
Story, so this lease is the only guard against a concurrent
`single-story-init` clobbering an in-flight run.

**Fail-closed.** Unlike `/deliver`, the standalone path
has **no Epic-scoped lifecycle ledger** to read a per-owner
`story.heartbeat` from, so there is no live-heartbeat source to decide
whether a foreign claim is stale. Rather than silently reclaim every
foreign assignee (which would leave the guard inert), the standalone lease
**fails closed**: a foreign assignee is treated as a _live_ claim. Outcomes:

- **Unclaimed / self-held** → init proceeds (a self-held claim is
  re-affirmed without re-writing assignees).
- **Any foreign assignee** → init **exits non-zero** with a message naming
  the current owner. Coordinate with that operator, or pass **`--steal`** to
  forcibly transfer the claim once you have confirmed the other run is dead.

`--dry-run` skips the lease (no assignee mutation). The matching release
runs in `single-story-close.js` (Step 3).

### Branch reuse

When a `story-<id>` branch already exists locally, init **reuses** it rather
than re-creating it (re-running `git branch` on an existing ref throws
`branch already exists`). The seed decision (`reuse` / `fetch` / `create`)
keys off local + remote ref presence, so re-running init on a
partially-initialized Story is idempotent.

### Merged-`story-*` sweep

Between the fetch and the branch-seed step, the script runs a
**merged-`story-*` sweep**: it invokes the same primitive as
`<agentRoot>/scripts/git-cleanup.js` (`<agentRoot>` resolves
from `project.paths.agentRoot`, default `.agents`) scoped to `story-*`
only, in `--execute --remote` mode, with the current run's
`story-<id>` branch excluded from the candidate list. Local refs, the
matching `origin/` ref, and stale tracking refs for any merged sibling
stories are reaped in one pass. The sweep never blocks init — failures
are logged and the new story is initialized regardless.

The sweep applies two hardening layers:

- **Per-candidate protection.** Each merged-PR candidate is filtered
  through three guards before reaching `executeCleanup`:
  - `unpushed-work` — branch HEAD SHA differs from the PR's
    `headRefOid`, meaning the operator has commits the merge didn't
    capture.
  - `dirty-tree` — the attached worktree (if any) has uncommitted
    changes.
  - `ticket-not-done` — the parent Story ticket isn't closed and
    doesn't carry `agent::done`.
    Protected candidates are skipped, listed in the sweep result envelope
    under `protected[]`, and named in the `CLEANUP` log line so the
    operator can see what was preserved.
- **Cross-session lock.** The sweep acquires a process-scoped lockfile
  at `<tempRoot>/single-story-sweep.lock` before planning. On
  contention (another `/deliver-story` already in the sweep
  step), this run's sweep is **skipped** with a warn log; init
  continues normally. Stale lockfiles (mtime older than the timeout)
  are treated as expired. The timeout defaults to 60 seconds and is
  overridable via `delivery.worktreeIsolation.sweepLockMs` in
  `.agentrc.json`.

Both layers are non-fatal — sweep failure / skip never blocks init, and
the new story is always created. `--dry-run` also skips the sweep.

### Worktree scope is not just the Bash cwd

`cd <workCwd>` steers the **Bash** tool's working directory, but it does
**not** scope the path-based **Edit/Write/Read** tools — those resolve
**absolute paths** and ignore the shell cwd. On Windows especially, an agent
whose shell sits in the worktree can still silently edit the **main
checkout** if it resolves a main-checkout absolute path. To stay in the
worktree you MUST prefix **every Edit/Write/Read path with the absolute
worktree root** (the `workCwd` value from Step 0), not merely `cd` into it.
Never edit files under the bare main-checkout root. `single-story-close.js`
runs a **wrong-tree guard** that aborts close and posts a
`friction` comment if it finds uncommitted tracked-path edits in the main
checkout while the worktree is the active work tree — but that is a backstop,
not a substitute for prefixing paths correctly.

---

## Engine invariants and the lite route

**Prerequisites before Step 0.** A `type::story` issue, a clean
`gh auth status`, and `project.baseBranch` present both locally and on
`origin` — init seeds the Story branch from the base branch and probes the
remote, so a missing or unauthenticated remote surfaces as a
`remoteVerified: false` block rather than a useful error.

The v2 engine's trait table:

| Trait         | v2 `/deliver-story`                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ticket type   | `type::story` only                                                       |
| Branch        | `story-<id>` seeded from `project.baseBranch` (`main`)                   |
| Merge target  | `main` via PR (squash + required checks)                                 |
| Spec / slices | Folded `## Spec` + optional `## Slicing` checkpoints in-session          |
| Ceremony      | Per-Story, routed off the derived change level via `ceremony-routing.js` |

**Ceremony-lite Stories still land through this engine unchanged.** A
lite-routed Story collapses only the _advisory_ plan/deliver
ceremony — the fresh-critic / Tech-Spec authoring a one-artifact scope does
not earn. It does **not** get a cheaper landing: the close-validation gates
(lint / test / format / coverage / CRAP / maintainability), the PR to `main`,
and the `rules/security-baseline.md` MUSTs all run exactly as for a
full-ceremony Story. The lite route's `preserves` field is the machine-readable
record of those non-negotiables; there is no lite-specific gate bypass.

**Deliver derives the route from the Story body's shape — and the
dispatch mode from the run.** Persist stamps a lite cohort's Stories with the
`route::lite` label as a _human-visible hint only_ (and ledgers the authored
verdict — recorded reason plus per-Story shape evidence — on the
`story-plan-state` checkpoint); the label is never the control signal.
`/deliver` computes the route from the fetched Story body via
`resolveStoryDispatchMode` (`lib/orchestration/complexity-gate.js`) — the same
shape taxonomy `deriveChangeLevel` applies to the landed diff at close:
`changes[]` count, acceptance count, creates-vs-refactors mix, sensitive-path
classes. A footprint intersecting a sensitive-path class derives `full` —
sensitivity wins, and the Story keeps its fresh acceptance critic.

That derived route sets ceremony. It does **not** set the dispatch mode,
because `inline` names one indivisible resource — the router's own session —
and only run topology can say whether it is free: a **single-Story run**
executes inline, and every Story of a multi-Story run dispatches as a
`story-worker` sub-agent whatever its shape — a lite shape makes the work
cheap, it does not conjure a second session for a sibling. Inline
execution changes the isolation only: the engine, every script gate, and the
terminal envelope are byte-identical either way.

---

## Step 1 — Implementation detail

**Docs context — digest-first.** Read a full doc only when the Story's own
context points you at one — do not ingest the whole
`project.docsContextFiles` set up front. If the caller provides a
`docsDigestPath`, prefer that compact outline and pull individual files on
demand. See [`.agents/instructions.md` § 3](../../instructions.md).

**Write-time audit checklists.** When the caller provides a `checklistPath`
(footprint-matched **local**-lens authoring checklists), read it before you
write and self-check as you author. When absent, lens-aware coverage still
runs maker-blind at Story-scope review inside the close subprocess. The
dispatch step produces `checklistPath` from the Story's predicted footprint
before it spawns the worker — see [`/deliver`](../deliver.md).

**Pre-eval full-suite discipline (spine step 5).** Repo-invariant guards —
drift-guard and schema tests living outside the Story's scoped greps — are
the failure class that actually bounces deliveries: close-validation
discovers them only after the whole close pipeline has run, at several times
the cost of one pre-eval full-suite run.

**Conflict with `main` mid-implementation** → resolve as you would any branch
rebase. There is no `epic/<id>` intermediate, so the rebase base is `main`
directly.

### Step 1a — self-eval mechanics

**One verdict-owner per cluster.** The ceremony routing's
resolved decision names each cluster's single verdict owner
(`verdictOwner: 'fresh-critic' | 'inline-self-eval'` from
`resolveCeremonyForRisk`): the fresh maker-blind critic when sensitivity
routes the cluster `fresh`, the contract-identical inline self-eval when it
routes `inline`. Exactly one pass authors the verdict — never both, and
never a preliminary self-assessment pass before dispatching the fresh
critic (the redundant pre-pass buys no measurable quality and roughly
triples the acceptance-block cost). `acceptance-eval.js` is the
deterministic **scorer** of that one authored verdict — schema validation,
round cap, proceed / redraft / block — not an independent additional pass
over the criteria. The M4-B floor holds: one verdict per cluster, the
cluster count owned by `acceptance-clusters.js` alone.

**One round = N cluster critics → ONE merged verdict → ONE gate call.** The
clusters are how a round is _authored_; they are not how it is _scored_.
Concatenate every cluster's records into a single `criteria[]` ordered by
`index` — exactly one per `acceptance[]` item, under one `storyId`,
`schemaVersion`, `round` and `commitSha` — and hand that merged file to the
gate once, with `--expected-criteria` set to the Story's `acceptance[]` count:

```bash
node <main-repo>/.agents/scripts/acceptance-eval.js \
  --story <storyId> --verdict <merged-verdict-path> \
  --expected-criteria <acceptance[] count>
```

The flag is what makes the merge enforceable: `assertCriteriaCoverage` returns
early on the `null` default, so **omitting it leaves the guard inert** and a
single cluster's verdict handed over unmerged scores a fraction of the criteria
and still reports `proceed`. A length mismatch is rejected before scoring and
consumes no round. Calling the gate once per cluster instead spends a round
_per cluster_ — a Story past the cluster ceiling would burn its whole redraft
budget on cluster arithmetic — and N concurrent calls race the Story-scoped
round ledger. Full per-round mechanics, including the parallel dispatch and the
merge shape: [`acceptance-self-eval.md`](acceptance-self-eval.md).

**Critic evidence-share.** When the critic runs a `verify[]`
command that is byte-identical to a close gate (`lint` / `typecheck`), it
records the pass into the Story evidence keyspace via `--standalone` so
close short-circuits the gate at unchanged HEAD. Run it in the **Story
worktree** (`workCwd` from Step 0):

```bash
node <main-repo>/.agents/scripts/evidence-gate.js \
  --standalone --scope-id <storyId> --gate lint \
  --worktree <workCwd> -- npm run lint
```

**On `decision: "block"`** — post a `friction` comment naming the unmet
criteria, then transition the Story to `agent::blocked`:

```bash
node .agents/scripts/diagnose-friction.js --story <storyId> \
  --cmd node .agents/scripts/acceptance-eval.js --story <storyId> --verdict <verdict-path>
node .agents/scripts/update-ticket-state.js --ticket <storyId> --state agent::blocked
```

---

## Step 2 — Ceremony detail

**Compute the change set once** with the shared enumerator —
the same module close uses — and reuse that one list downstream:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e '
  import { computeChangeSet } from "<main-repo>/.agents/scripts/lib/orchestration/change-set.js";
  const { files } = computeChangeSet({ baseRef: "main", headRef: "story-<storyId>" });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(files));
'
```

Derive the level with
[`deriveChangeLevel`](../../scripts/lib/orchestration/review-depth.js) over
the one computed change-set list: a diff touching a sensitive path registered
in `.agents/schemas/audit-rules.json` derives `high`, one touching none
derives `low`, and an unenumerable diff (`files === null`) derives `null`.
Hand the **same** list to every acceptance critic you spawn (Step 1a) — a
critic that re-ran its own `git diff` could score against a different set
than the one that routed it.

Resolve fresh-vs-inline acceptance critics per AC-cluster with
[`resolveCeremonyForRisk`](../../scripts/lib/orchestration/ceremony-routing.js)
(`minimal` → always inline; `strict` → always fresh; `standard` →
`high`/`null` → `fresh`, `low` → `inline` unless the `freshCriticSampleRate`
floor forces `fresh`). Review depth reads the same derived level via
`review-depth.js` inside close, so the two decisions cannot disagree.

**Inline-dispatch override.** When the Story dispatches
`inline` (`resolveStoryDispatchMode` → `inline`, i.e. a single-Story run), run
every acceptance critic **inline** — do not spawn fresh-context critic
sub-agents regardless of what the profile would otherwise resolve. The self-eval rigor
(scoring each `acceptance[]` item against the one computed change set, with
`verify[]` output as evidence) is unchanged; only the sub-agent boot is
removed. Hard gates are untouched.

---

## Step 3 — Merge wait, async mode, and flags

**Step 3 is the orchestrator's, and it is serialized.** A dispatched
`story-worker` ends its turn at a pushed branch (spine § Step 2.5); the session
that dispatched it runs close. Two reasons, both measured rather than
theoretical:

1. **A sub-agent cannot resume itself.** It gets no notification when a
   backgrounded close finishes, so a worker that backgrounds close and ends its
   turn strands the envelope in a turn nobody reads — three of five workers in
   one measured wave did exactly that despite an explicit foreground-close
   instruction. Moving the seam removes the failure instead of re-wording the
   prohibition. The parent, by contrast, is still live and _does_ observe and
   retry its own close.
2. **Closes contend; implementation does not.** Close syncs from
   `origin/<baseBranch>`, pushes, opens a PR and arms auto-merge — two of those
   in flight race on the base branch, the merge queue and the shared checkout.
   So implementation may fan out across the wave, but the tail runs **one Story
   at a time**: a worker that hands back while another close is running waits in
   the orchestrator's queue.

A worker therefore returns a hand-off report, not a terminal envelope, and that
is the expected shape — only close mints an envelope. Never answer a missing
envelope with a re-dispatch: `single-story-init.js` re-run under a live branch
is how one Story ends up with two closes. Close the pushed branch, or probe with
`deliver-recover.js` and run the one command it prints.

**What close does internally.** The script runs the close-validation gates
against `baseBranch`, syncs the Story branch from `origin/<baseBranch>`
(the parallel-race defence), pushes `story-<id>`, opens (or
reuses) a PR against `baseBranch` with a `Closes #<storyId>` footer, enables
GitHub native auto-merge (`--auto --squash --delete-branch`) **when
`delivery.ci.autoMerge` is `"trust-ci"` (the default)**, flips the Story to
`agent::closing`, reaps the worktree, releases the lease, then **waits for
the merge** and — on a confirmed merge — flips `agent::done` and runs the
post-land tail.

**The merge wait is bounded and resumable.** Two budgets, deliberately
separate (`delivery.mergeWatch.*`):

- **`maxWaitSeconds`** (default 300) bounds **one invocation**, sized to fit
  inside a single host tool invocation (~10 min ceiling) alongside the gates
  that precede it. Expiry → `pending`. Pass `--max-wait-seconds <n>` to raise
  it when your host has no such ceiling and you want to land in one block.
- **`maxBudgetSeconds`** (default 3600) bounds the **cumulative** wait across
  resumes, anchored at the PR's `createdAt` so resuming does not restart the
  clock. Exhausting _this_ is the genuine give-up → `blocked`.

The wait probes the checks every poll: a red required check fails fast as
`checks-failed` instead of burning the budget, and a PR that falls behind its
base is brought up to date within `updateAttempts` tries.

**Async merge-confirm mode (`delivery.mergeWatch.mode: "async"`).** Under
the default `"sync"` the merge wait runs in the foreground as described above.

**On a multi-Story run, async is the posture — pass `--merge-watch-mode async`
on every close.** This is not a slow-CI opt-in. Implementation fans out, but
the close tail is serialized one Story at a time, and under `sync` each close
holds the foreground for its full merge wait before the next may start; that
is the run's dominant serialized cost, paid once per sibling. Close sees one
Story and cannot see run topology, so the orchestrator — which can — makes the
call per invocation while the config default stays `"sync"`, which is right for
a solo delivery with no sibling waiting behind it
([`deliver-reference.md`](deliver-reference.md) § Async merge-confirm mode).
A slow-CI consumer reaches for the same mode for the separate reason that a
foreground wait longer than the host tool ceiling (~10 min) almost always
expires `pending` after burning ~5 minutes of the slot — `"async"` makes that
confirm a designed ending instead of an expiry accident.

In async mode the close arms auto-merge, runs one short **~60s
probe window** (long enough to catch an instant merge and, via the
head-anchored required-check predicate, an instantly-red required check),
then returns the standard `pending` terminal with a `nextCommand`. When you
receive that `pending` envelope, launch its `nextCommand`
(`single-story-confirm-merge.js … --wait`) as a **background** invocation —
host **background Bash** (`run_in_background`), whose completion re-invokes
the agent — and continue; do **not** sit in a foreground poll the tool
ceiling will kill. `single-story-confirm-merge.js` is already idempotent and
owns the whole tail, so no new state holder is needed, and
`deliver-recover.js` remains the recovery path for an orphaned confirm. The
cumulative `maxBudgetSeconds` give-up is unchanged; `"sync"` behaviour is
byte-compatible.

**`delivery.ci.autoMerge` policy.** Under the default `"trust-ci"`, GitHub
native auto-merge is armed and the PR squash-merges once its **required**
checks pass. Under `"strict"`, the close **does not arm auto-merge** — the
PR opens and waits for an **operator merge**, exactly as `--no-auto-merge`
does per-run.

**When to reach for a close flag.** What each one _does_ is in
`node .agents/scripts/single-story-close.js --help`; below is only the
judgment that help text cannot carry.

- `--skip-validation` — only when re-running close after a fixed gate
  failure that's already known to pass.
- `--skip-sync` — only after a hand-resolved sync, or in tests.
- `--no-auto-merge` — when the PR materially changes behaviour and warrants a
  pre-merge eyeball; the operator then merges via the GitHub UI.
- `--wait-merge` — **close-and-land**. When neither land flag
  is passed, close defaults from `delivery.routing.closeAndLand` (**true**):
  attended and headless delivers share the land-in-one-close happy path.
- `--no-wait-merge` — the explicit opt-out always wins. Use when the operator
  wants the PR left at `agent::closing` for a human land (or a wrapper that
  will invoke `single-story-confirm-merge.js` itself). Reports `pending` —
  the work is not done, nothing is broken, and one named command finishes it.
- `--max-wait-seconds <n>` — from a headless caller with no host
  tool-invocation ceiling, to keep single-block semantics
  without editing the consumer's config.
- `--merge-watch-mode <sync|async>` — the per-invocation override of
  `delivery.mergeWatch.mode`. **Pass `async` on every close of a multi-Story
  run** (above); leave it off for a solo delivery. It composes with
  `--max-wait-seconds` — pass both and the explicit bound still wins over the
  async probe cap. An unrecognized value is refused before any phase runs, so a
  typo cannot silently drop the run back onto synchronous waiting; the refusal
  reports a `failed` terminal envelope at `phase: init`, mutating nothing.

---

## Step 3 — Close pipeline detail

The `single-story-close.js` script, in order:

1. Runs the close-validation gates against `baseBranch` as the baseline.
   On any gate failure it throws — the operator fixes and re-runs close.
   **Gate output is captured, not streamed.** Every gate line
   goes to `temp/orchestration/close-gates-<storyId>.log`; a clean run reports
   one digest line naming that artifact, and a **failed** gate replays its
   captured tail inline so the evidence is in front of you without opening a
   file. Read the artifact when you need the full text — or re-run under
   `AGENT_LOG_LEVEL=verbose` for live streaming.
   1a. **Syncs the Story branch from `origin/<baseBranch>`** before push.
   Runs `git fetch origin <baseBranch>` followed by
   `git merge --no-edit origin/<baseBranch>` inside the worktree. This
   defends against the parallel-`/deliver-story` race: when
   multiple sessions run in parallel, the Story that auto-merges first
   bumps `baseBranch`, and without this sync the lagging Stories open
   PRs that are "behind base" and stall against branch-protection's
   `up-to-date branch` rule. Outcomes:
   - **No-op / fast-forward / clean merge-commit** → close proceeds to
     push.
   - **Merge conflict** → the merge is aborted, a `friction` structured
     comment is posted on the Story (conflicting file list + recovery
     command set), the Story flips to `agent::blocked`, and close
     throws. Resolve in the worktree (`git merge origin/<base>` + fix
     conflicts + `git commit --no-edit`) and re-run
     `/deliver-story`.
   - **Fetch failed** → close throws with the git stderr; no label
     transition.

   Note: the merge queue (when enabled) re-tests each PR against the
   queue tip before merging, so this sync + merge queue is the complete
   defence against the parallel race. Without merge queue, the sync
   closes the PR-open-time race but a residual race remains between PR
   open and auto-merge fire.

2. Pushes `story-<id>` to `origin`.
3. Probes for an existing open PR with `head = story-<id>`. If none
   exists, opens one via `gh pr create --base <baseBranch>`. The PR
   body carries `Closes #<storyId>` so the GitHub merge auto-closes the
   issue.
   3a. **Enables GitHub native auto-merge by default** via
   `gh pr merge <prNumber> --auto --squash --delete-branch`. Once CI's
   required checks turn green, GitHub squash-merges the PR and deletes
   the source branch — the operator does not need to babysit the merge
   button. Mirrors the `/deliver` finalize path. Failure is
   non-fatal: the operator retains the manual merge surface in the
   GitHub UI. Pass `--no-auto-merge` to opt out when the PR needs a
   pre-merge eyeball.
4. Flips the Story to **`agent::closing`** (NOT `agent::done`) and leaves
   the GitHub issue **OPEN**. Auto-merge completes
   asynchronously _after_ this script exits, so closing the issue here
   would strand a CLOSED issue with no merged work if the PR later failed
   CI, went `BEHIND` base, or was closed without merging. The Story rests
   at `agent::closing` while the PR is open with auto-merge armed; the
   `agent::done` flip (which closes the issue) is deferred to Step 5's
   merge confirmation — `single-story-confirm-merge.js` on a
   `--no-wait-merge` run, or the in-close confirm phase on the
   close-and-land default. (Step 5.5 is the Status-column resync.) A Story
   only reaches `agent::done` once its PR to `main` is confirmed merged.
5. Reaps the worktree when `delivery.worktreeIsolation.reapOnSuccess`
   is enabled.
6. **Releases the Story lease.** Clears the Story assignment
   that init claimed so the next `/deliver-story` run sees an
   unclaimed ticket. The release is a no-op when the operator no longer
   holds the claim (a later run took over via reclaim/steal), so a late
   close never yanks a live claim away from its current owner. Best-effort:
   a release failure is logged but does not fail an otherwise-clean close.
   Note the lease does **not** expire on its own: the standalone lease is
   fail-closed by design (it anchors its heartbeat to now, so a foreign
   claim always reads as live regardless of the configured TTL), so a
   claim stranded by a failed release is cleared only by `--steal` or by
   de-assigning the ticket. The close result carries
   `leaseReleased: <boolean>`.

`--skip-validation` bypasses Step 1 (gates). Use only when re-running
close after a fixed gate failure that's already known to pass.

`--skip-sync` bypasses Step 1a (base-sync). Use only when re-running
close after a hand-resolved sync, or in tests.

`--no-auto-merge` disables Step 3a. Use when the PR materially changes
behaviour and warrants pre-merge review.

---

## Step 4 — CI watch + fix recovery

Enter this step **only** when Step 3 returned `blocked` with
`blockClass: "checks-failed"` (a required check went red), or when a
`--no-wait-merge` run left the PR for you to shepherd. When a required check is
red, the agent owns the green-CI outcome, not just the push: local
close-validation gates pass on the dev host's environment; CI runs on a
different OS and concurrency, and coverage rounding, platform-conditional
branches, and timing-sensitive tests routinely drift between the two.

Fix the failure and push a new commit on `story-<storyId>` — the watcher
**disarmed native auto-merge on the first red** and re-arms it
only when the checks go green on a **new head SHA**, so the fix must be a real
commit — then resume the land with the envelope's `nextCommand`.

To watch the checks on the red path, drive `pr-watch-with-update.js` — the
**single CI-watch mechanism**. It polls the required checks to a
terminal state and auto-recovers from `mergeStateStatus: BEHIND`; do **not**
fall back to a bare `gh pr checks` watch invocation:

```bash
node <agentRoot>/scripts/pr-watch-with-update.js --pr <prNumber> --story <storyId>
```

`--story` is what keys the red-path CI digest
(`temp/story-<id>-ci-digest.{json,md}` — failing check name, the PR head SHA,
run id + run link, and a `gh run view --log-failed` tail). Omit it and a red
check writes no digest — and with no digest the no-rerun guard has nothing to
adjudicate the next green against, so always pass it.
Poll cadence and caps come from `delivery.ci.watch.*` (`pollIntervalMs`,
`maxPolls`, `maxResumes`, `attachWindowMs`); pass `--poll-interval-ms`,
`--max-polls`, `--max-resumes`, or `--attach-window-ms` to override for one run.
`attachWindowMs` (default 20 min) is how long the watch keeps re-resolving an
**empty** required-check set before it stops waiting for a context to attach —
a required context that is an aggregator job gated on every other tier is the
last check to appear, measured at 16m52s on this repository.

Add `--repo owner/repo` only when the cwd is not the target repository; it
reaches `gh` as a real flag. There is no `<owner/repo>#<number>` ref form —
`gh` parses that as a branch name.

When the watch exits, branch on the exit code:

- **Exit 0 (all checks ✓)** — auto-merge will fire (or has already). The Story
  is still at `agent::closing` with its issue OPEN. **Proceed to merge
  confirmation (§ Step 5) within the same turn** — green CI is the _start_ of
  the merge-confirm sequence, not a terminal state.
- **Exit 1 (a check genuinely failed, the green was a forbidden re-run, or the
  PR itself could not be read)** —
  diagnose, fix at source, and push a new commit on `story-<storyId>`, then
  re-watch: the watcher disarmed auto-merge on the red and re-arms it only for
  a green on a **new head SHA**. The Story stays at `agent::closing`
  throughout, so a failed/abandoned PR never strands a CLOSED issue. If the
  same failure class recurs, hand convergence off to a self-paced host loop
  (`/loop`) that applies the smallest fix and pushes a new commit each pass —
  **never** a bare re-run of the failed job. A green the guard rejects as a
  re-run of the same commit flips the Story to `agent::blocked` with a
  `friction` comment; clear it per
  [`ci-remediation.md`](../../rules/ci-remediation.md) § Verifier.
- **Exit 2 (slow, not red)** — one of three slow conditions, **never** a
  failure and never a green. Hand the wait off to the host's interval loop
  rather than ending your turn: `/loop 5m` polling `gh pr checks` until the
  checks settle. The envelope names which:
  - **still-running** — the poll cap fired with checks still pending and the
    watcher exhausted its resume budget with nothing red.
  - **not-yet-started** (`notYetStarted: true`) — the attach window was spent
    and **no** required context ever attached, while the PR kept reading back
    fine. CI has not started; there is no failing check and no CI digest to
    read. Do **not** treat it as red — nothing needs fixing, and re-watching
    (or raising `attachWindowMs`) is the whole remediation.
  - **unresolved** (`reconciliation.reconciled: false`) — every observed
    required check is green but the repository still refuses the merge, so the
    green verdict is withheld.

**Triage authority.** How to classify and remediate a red (or repeatedly slow)
check — the root-cause-only decision tree for infra/transient and flaky failures
(reproduce → check `main` → bisect env vs code → fix in-scope or file a
`meta::framework-gap` issue), the never-rerun / never-quarantine prohibitions,
and the escalation criteria (three-strikes, the 30-minute wall-clock timebox,
and the clearly-environmental fast path) — is defined once in
[`.agents/rules/ci-remediation.md`](../../rules/ci-remediation.md). Read it
before remediating a red check.

### The auto-merge wait is an internally-blocking step

This is the single most important contract of this workflow, and the seam
where a worker most often misbehaves: it delivers up to arming auto-merge,
then ends its turn with **free-form prose** — e.g. "I'll wait for the
background watch task to complete" or "the next event will be its completion
notification" — leaving the merge unconfirmed and the Story stranded at
`agent::closing`. **Do not do this.**
`pr-watch-with-update.js --pr <prNumber>` _blocks the current turn_ until CI
resolves — that is the mechanism by which you wait. You MUST keep your turn alive
across the wait: watch → (fix + push + re-watch on red) → confirm the merge
(Step 5) → flip `agent::done` → run the post-merge steps → and only then
return the terminal JSON status contract. The CI wait NEVER terminates your
turn; **only** a confirmed-`MERGED` PR (→ `status: "done"`), an
`agent::blocked` transition (→ `status: "blocked"`), or an unrecoverable
failure (→ `status: "failed"`) does. Ending your turn with prose and an
unconfirmed merge is a contract violation — it is the very bug this workflow
exists to prevent.

### Resurrecting the worktree after `reapOnSuccess`

`single-story-close.js` reaps the worktree on success when
`delivery.worktreeIsolation.reapOnSuccess` is enabled (the default). To
fix CI you must re-attach a worktree to the existing remote branch:

```bash
cd <main-repo>
git fetch origin story-<storyId>
git worktree add .worktrees/story-<storyId> story-<storyId>
cd .worktrees/story-<storyId>
```

Do **not** re-run `single-story-init.js` — it would reset the branch
state and lose the close commit's structured comment.

### Diagnosing the failure

Pull the failing job log via:

```bash
gh run view <runId> --repo <owner>/<repo> --log-failed
```

The `<runId>` is the run number that `gh pr checks` shows in the
failing row's URL. Read the bottom of the log — the gate that exited
non-zero is named there (e.g. `[Coverage] ❌ REGRESSION in …`).

### Fixing without re-running close-validation

For coverage / maintainability / CRAP regressions detected only on CI:

1. Update the relevant baseline file (`baselines/coverage.json`,
   `baselines/maintainability.json`, `baselines/crap.json`) to absorb
   CI's actual numbers. Edit by hand when CI's numbers are within the
   tolerance you'd otherwise accept — don't re-run `npm run … :update`
   locally, because Windows numbers will overwrite CI's Linux numbers
   and the cycle repeats.
2. Commit the baseline delta with a `chore(baselines):` message that
   names the CI run that produced the values.
3. `git push` to `origin/story-<storyId>` and re-watch.

For genuine test failures (a flaky test, a platform-conditional bug):
fix the code or test, commit, push, re-watch. Keep iterating until
the watch exits clean.

### When to stop iterating

- **Three consecutive failures with the same fix shape** — stop and
  Re-Plan per Anti-Thrashing Protocol. The diagnosis is likely wrong.
- **Operator-blocking failure** (security scanner, branch-protection
  rule the agent can't change) — transition the Story to
  `agent::blocked`, summarize the blocker on the PR, and yield to the
  operator.

### Idempotence of the loop {#idempotence}

- The PR stays open across retries; `gh pr create` is a one-shot at
  close, the loop only pushes new commits.
- Auto-merge is disarmed by the watcher on the first red and re-armed
  when the checks go green on a new head SHA; pushing a new commit is
  what re-opens the merge path.
- If the operator manually merges or disables auto-merge mid-loop,
  exit the loop and report.

## Step 5 — Merge confirmation detail

> On the default path Step 3 already did this. Run it only to resume a
> `pending` envelope, to finish a `--no-wait-merge` run, or to rescue a
> merged-but-mislabelled Story.

```bash
node .agents/scripts/single-story-confirm-merge.js --story <storyId> --cwd <main-repo>
```

This is the **same** shared land path Step 3 reaches: it flips
`agent::closing → agent::done` on a confirmed merge (closing the issue) and runs
the **same** post-land tail — so the two surfaces cannot diverge. It is
idempotent, emits the same terminal envelope, and is safe to re-run while the PR
is still open (returns `pending`).

`single-story-confirm-merge.js` re-reads the live PR state (`gh pr view
--json state,mergedAt`, probing `gh pr list --head story-<id> --state all`
when `--pr` is omitted) and:

- **PR `MERGED`** → flips `agent::closing → agent::done`, closing the
  issue, and fires the `story-merged` notify. Prints
  `{ action: 'done', merged: true, ... }`.
- **PR still open / closed-without-merge** → leaves the Story at
  `agent::closing` (issue stays OPEN) and prints
  `{ action: 'pending', reason: 'pr-open' | 'pr-not-merged' | 'no-pr' }`.
  Re-run after the merge lands.
- **Story already `agent::done` / issue already closed** → idempotent
  `{ action: 'noop', reason: 'already-done' }`.

The issue closes exactly when the work has merged, never at PR-open.

---

## Step 5.5 — Re-assert Status column detail

> **The land tail already ran this** — it is `tail.statusResync`
> in the terminal envelope. Run it by hand only when that step reported
> `false`, or after a manual merge on a `--no-wait-merge` run.

```bash
node .agents/scripts/resync-status-column.js --story <storyId>
```

The helper re-fires the `ColumnSync` mutation and **polls for ~15 s** to win the
race against the bot's late write. It is idempotent and
no-op-safe (`no-project` / `not-on-project` exit 0).

The GitHub Projects v2 built-in workflows `Pull request merged` and
`Pull request linked to issue` are enabled by default on most boards
and fire ~minutes _after_ auto-merge lands. They overwrite the Status
field as a side-effect, clobbering the `Done` value
`single-story-confirm-merge.js` set at the `agent::done` flip in Step 5
and leaving closed Stories stuck at `In Progress` on the board. The
confirmation step has already exited by then, so the bot gets the last
write.

`resync-status-column.js`:

- Reads the ticket's current `agent::*` label set (now `agent::done`).
- Re-fires the same `ColumnSync` mutation `transitionTicketState` used
  at close, overwriting the bot's late write.
- **Polls the live Status for ~15 s after the initial write** and
  re-fires on drift. Without this loop, a one-shot
  mutation routinely lost the race against the bot's asynchronous
  fire.
- Prints a single-line JSON envelope:
  `{ ticketId, status, column?, reason?, attempts? }`. `attempts > 1`
  means the helper had to fight a bot overwrite; `status: 'drifted'`
  means the bot won every attempt in the poll budget (rare; usually
  signals operator should reap the conflicting workflows).

Tuning flags are rarely needed; the script enumerates them itself
(`node .agents/scripts/resync-status-column.js --help`).

Idempotent: re-running on a ticket whose Status already matches the
target returns the same envelope. No-op skips (`no-project`,
`no-meta`, `not-on-project`) exit 0 with the reason in the envelope
so the workflow can continue.

**Canonical operator fix:** run
`node .agents/scripts/agents-bootstrap-github.js --reap-conflicting-workflows`
once per project to delete the conflicting bot workflows entirely.
This eliminates the race source; the poll loop becomes pure
defense-in-depth against re-enabled or future workflows.

## Step 6 — Local branch cleanup detail

> **The land tail already ran this** — it is `tail.refCleanup` and
> `tail.baseFastForward` in the terminal envelope, done in-process against the
> same planners this command drives. Run it by hand only when either step
> reported `false` (a dirty shared checkout is the common, benign cause), or
> after a manual merge on a `--no-wait-merge` run. To prune the story ref **and**
> fast-forward local `main` (or `project.baseBranch`):

```bash
node .agents/scripts/git-cleanup.js \
  --execute \
  --remote \
  --yes \
  --fast-forward-main \
  --branches \
  --include "story-<storyId>"
```

`--fast-forward-main` brings local `main` current (the next init seeds from it),
`--branches` + `--include` reap only this Story's ref, and
`--execute --remote --yes` run the deletes non-interactively. The sweep is
idempotent and safe to run before `MERGED` confirms. Skip it only when the
operator opted out via `--no-auto-merge` AND has not yet merged the PR — run the
cleanup after the manual merge lands.

GitHub deletes the **remote** branch on auto-merge (via the
`--delete-branch` flag `single-story-close.js` passes to `gh pr merge`).
The **local** `story-<storyId>` ref, however, lingers in the main
checkout until something prunes it — `single-story-init.js` runs a
merged-sweep at the start of every _subsequent_ `/deliver-story`
invocation, but that's next-run cleanup, not end-of-run cleanup. Stale
local refs accumulate between sessions, clutter `git branch`, and shadow
the lessons the sweep is meant to surface.

**Why local `main` goes stale:** `single-story-init.js` seeds new
`story-<id>` branches from the **local** `baseBranch` ref (default
`main`). Auto-merge updates **`origin/main`** on GitHub; nothing in
close or the old Step 6 command updated **local `main`**. The next init
then forked from a tip six merges behind until you manually pulled.
`single-story-init` also attempts the same fast-forward after `git fetch`
when the main checkout is clean (defense in depth if Step 6 was skipped).
Step 6 must still run `--fast-forward-main` so local `main` is current
before the next session — init may skip when the tree is dirty or the
operator is mid-checkout on another branch.

What the Step 6 cleanup command does:

- **`--fast-forward-main`** fetches `origin/<baseBranch>` and
  `git merge --ff-only` on the main checkout when the tree is clean and
  the local base is strictly behind remote. Skipped when already current,
  dirty, or diverged (see `/git-cleanup`).
- **`--branches`** reaps the merged `story-<storyId>` ref (worktree,
  local branch, stale `origin/` tracking ref). Does not run
  `--prune-remotes` or `--stashes` unless you add those flags.
- **`--include "story-<storyId>"`** scopes the branch reap to this
  Story's ref only — sibling stories in flight are untouched.
- **`--execute --remote --yes`** actually deletes the local ref, prunes
  the matching `origin/` tracking ref, and runs non-interactively.

The sweep is idempotent. It is safe to run before `state: "MERGED"`
confirms (it will skip a not-yet-merged branch), and safe to re-run
after a successful cleanup (it reports "no merged branches to clean
up").

---

## Idempotence and the standing constraints

Every script in the chain no-ops safely on re-run: `single-story-init.js`
re-prints `workCwd` for an already-initialized Story; `single-story-close.js`
and `single-story-confirm-merge.js` short-circuit on a closed or `agent::done`
Story; the PR probe reuses an open PR rather than opening a second one. That is
what makes the recovery router safe to walk more than once.

The four constraints the spine states without arguing for them:

- **Never push the Story branch directly to `main`.** The PR is the only merge
  surface — a direct push bypasses required checks and the squash title
  release-please parses.
- **Always prefix path-based tools with the absolute `workCwd` root.** `cd`
  scopes Bash, not Edit/Write/Read; close's wrong-tree guard is a backstop for
  the mistake, not a licence to make it.
- **Report state, not process.** Mirror the close envelope's fields; step
  narration reads as progress while telling the caller nothing it can branch on.
- **Drive every `agent::*` transition through `update-ticket-state.js`** so the
  label, the Projects Status column and the lifecycle event stay in one motion.

## Step 7 — Return-contract detail

The field-level contract is the shipped schema
[`story-deliver-terminal.schema.json`](../../schemas/story-deliver-terminal.schema.json)
— not this file, and not
[`agents/story-worker.md`](../../agents/story-worker.md). All three used to
carry their own prose version; the schema is now the only definition. What
follows is the _judgement_ around it, which a schema cannot express.

### `pending` is a real status — and it is not a park

`pending` is a real terminal status with its own exit code (3) — the honest
name for a close-and-land whose CI outlived the host's ~10-minute
tool-invocation ceiling, which would otherwise park the Story at
`agent::closing` with no event and no label:

- It is **resumable**: no label was mutated, no `merge.unlanded` was emitted,
  and `nextCommand` names the one command that continues it. The cumulative
  budget is anchored at the PR's `createdAt`, so resuming does not restart the
  clock and the give-up bound still means something.
- It is **not** a park. Returning `pending` because you would rather not wait
  is the no-park failure mode wearing a schema. Return it only
  when the bound genuinely expired, or a human owns the merge.

The no-park rule holds: a turn that ends with prose ("I'll wait for the watch
task…", "the next event will be its completion notification…") and an
unconfirmed merge is a **contract violation** — the parent cannot distinguish
"still working" from "done but silent". `pending` is the honest,
machine-readable alternative: "not finished, here is exactly how to continue."

### The envelope also lands on disk

Stdout has exactly one reader — the turn that launched the close — and that
reader is not always still listening. A child that reports progress and ends
its turn while its close is mid-gate-chain is behaving reasonably, but the
envelope it never relayed is gone, and reconstructing the Story's state from
labels costs a recovery round trip plus a full resume of the child. Observed
four times across three workers in a single consumer run, on unrelated
footprints, and not new to that run.

So `emitTerminalEnvelope` — the one writer behind every emit site — also
persists the validated envelope to
`<tempRoot>/orchestration/story-deliver-terminal-<storyId>.json`:

- **It is the same object**, not a summary. Read it and branch exactly as you
  would on stdout; the copy is written before the markers are, so a caller
  that saw them can rely on the file.
- **It is best-effort.** A failed write returns null and changes nothing about
  the emitted envelope or the exit code — a landed PR must never become a
  crash because a temp directory was unwritable.
- **It is a fallback, not a licence.** The orchestrator running close still
  holds its turn until the envelope arrives; see § Step 3 above and
  [`agents/story-worker.md`](../../agents/story-worker.md).

`deliver-recover.js` reads the same artifact, plus the freshness of
`close-gates-<storyId>.log`, to split the one genuinely ambiguous row of its
table. `agent::executing` with no PR used to answer "Implementation never
finished" — false for the whole duration of a close, whose gates and push
happen before any PR exists, and actively hazardous, because acting on its
re-init suggestion can put a second close on one PR. It now answers
`close-in-flight` (a gate log touched inside the window: wait, then re-probe)
or `close-envelope-on-disk` (the close already reached a verdict: relay it),
and falls back to the original verdict only when neither artifact exists.

### Exit-code compatibility note (`--no-wait-merge`)

Every close flag keeps its meaning, but the **exit code** of a
`--no-wait-merge` (or `--no-auto-merge` / `autoMerge: "strict"`) run changed:
it now exits **3** (`pending`) rather than 0, because the PR is open and a
human still owns the merge. Reporting `landed` would be a lie, and `landed` is
what exit 0 means. A wrapper that shells out and tests `exit == 0` to mean
"close finished" must be updated to treat 3 as the operator-merge success
path; `!= 0` no longer implies failure.

### Per-status judgement

- **`landed`** — the only status that means done. A `false` in `tail.*`
  degrades the report, never the land: the merge is on the base branch, and
  failing it because a Projects v2 mutation flaked would report a false
  negative about work that demonstrably shipped.
- **`pending`** — see above.
- **`blocked`** — you (or the close pipeline) transitioned the Story to
  `agent::blocked` and posted a `friction` comment. `blocked.blockClass` comes
  from the shared classifier, never an ad hoc string, and
  `blocked.frictionCommentId` points at the remediation.
- **`failed`** — an unrecoverable failure outside the blocked protocol.
  `phase` reflects where it died.
