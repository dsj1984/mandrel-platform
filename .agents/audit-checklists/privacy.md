# Privacy and PII Data Audit — authoring checklist

> Audit logs, telemetry, and persistence paths for PII leakage and retention violations; surface secrets exposure and consent gaps.

Self-check your change against this lens's concerns before you ship:

- [ ] Enumerate the sinks.
- [ ] Secret scan.
- [ ] Trace PII sources to the enumerated sinks.
- [ ] Data Minimization
- [ ] Leaky Logging
- [ ] Insecure Transmission
- [ ] Hardcoded Secrets
- [ ] Consent & Retention
