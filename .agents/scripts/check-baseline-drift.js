// .agents/scripts/check-baseline-drift.js — scheduled full-scope baseline
// drift check (Story #4776).
//
// The three per-PR enforcement sites (close-validation, pre-push, CI) are all
// diff-scoped: they compare the files a branch touched against their committed
// baseline rows. A file nobody touches after its row is written is therefore
// never re-scored, so drift introduced indirectly — a dependency getting more
// complex, coverage moving underneath a method — stays invisible indefinitely.
//
// This CLI is the periodic full-scope counterpart. It re-scores every target
// directory through the same scorer that writes the baseline, prints a per-row
// before/after table for everything that moved beyond the gate's tolerance,
// and exits non-zero when it finds any — so a consumer can wire it as a
// scheduled CI job without wrapping it in verdict-parsing glue. This repo
// schedules the maintainability kind in `.github/workflows/baseline-drift.yml`;
// a consumer materializing `.agents/` still owns its own schedule.
//
// `--require-scored` exists because the default skip-is-green contract below
// is a fail-open trap for exactly that scheduled use. Measured on this repo:
// `check-baseline-drift.js --gate crap` with no `coverage/coverage-final.json`
// present prints "✅ No baseline drift detected" and exits 0 — a nightly job
// wired that way reports green while having measured nothing. The flag turns
// every skip into exit 2, so a job that asked for a kind and did not get it
// reds instead.
//
// Exit codes:
//   0 — no drift (or every kind skipped: disabled gate, no baseline, no scorer)
//   1 — drift detected in at least one kind
//   2 — the check itself could not run (including: a requested kind was
//       skipped and `--require-scored` was passed)

// Fail-fast if the framework's runtime deps are not installed — must be the
// first import so the check runs before any third-party-importing sibling
// module is evaluated (Story #3432).

Re-score the configured baselines FULL-SCOPE and report every row whose
current score has drifted from its committed baseline by more than the
gate's tolerance — including files untouched by any recent diff, which the
diff-scoped gates structurally cannot see.

Options:
  --gate <kind>       Restrict to one kind (repeatable). Default: ${DRIFT_KINDS.join(', ')}.
  --tolerance <n>     Override the per-gate absolute tolerance.
  --require-scored    Treat a skipped kind (gate disabled, no baseline, no
                      scorer, nothing scored) as a failure rather than a pass.
                      Use this in scheduled jobs: without it a kind that could
                      not be scored at all reports green.
  --json              Emit the machine-readable report instead of the table.
  -h, --help          Show this help.

Exit codes: 0 no drift · 1 drift detected · 2 the check could not run.

On drift, refresh with the printed \`*:update -- --full-scope\` command and
commit the result with a \`baseline-refresh:\` tagged subject (non-empty body).`;
