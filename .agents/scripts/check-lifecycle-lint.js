/**
 * check-lifecycle-lint.js — enforce the lifecycle lint rules that biome's
 * stock ruleset cannot express.
 *
 * Rule 1 — "No Promise.all over the lifecycle surface".
 *   Files under `.agents/scripts/lib/orchestration/lifecycle/**` MUST NOT
 *   contain `Promise.all(`. The surface is the append-only ledger writer, and
 *   record ordering is the whole point of an append-only trail: a parallel
 *   write interleaves records and breaks the ordering a reader relies on.
 *   Tests under `tests/lifecycle/**` are exempt — fixtures that prove the rule
 *   bites need to carry the pattern.
 *
 *   (Story #5024 narrowed the rationale. It was "the bus is a strictly
 *   sequential mediator; parallelizing listeners breaks repeatability", which
 *   stopped being the reason when the bus was deleted. The rule still guards a
 *   real property of what remains.)
 *
 *   The old Rule 2 — "wildcard-observer firewall", gating any module under
 *   `lifecycle/listeners/**` that called `bus.on('*', …)` — was deleted by
 *   Story #5024 along with the bus. Both halves of its predicate became
 *   unsatisfiable in the same commit (the directory is gone and there is no
 *   `bus` to call `.on` on), so it returned zero violations by construction
 *   rather than by verification: a gate that cannot fire, of exactly the class
 *   Story #5004 retired `check-gherkin-placeholders.js` for.
 *
 * Rule 3 — "Auto-merge lockout" (Story #2253 / Task #2255, Epic #2172
 *   review High-1).
 *   String literals containing the substring `gh pr merge` MUST NOT
 *   appear in any file under `.agents/scripts/**` EXCEPT
 *   `lib/orchestration/single-story-close/phases/auto-merge.js` — the v2
 *   close path that replaced the Epic-era `AutomergeArmer` listener the rule
 *   was originally written against. The original safety hole was an
 *   unconditional `gh pr merge <pr> --auto --squash --delete-branch`
 *   call in `epic-deliver-finalize.js` that armed GitHub's native
 *   auto-merge BEFORE the framework's automerge predicate evaluated
 *   blocker / review state; the lockout backstops the deletion so a
 *   future refactor cannot quietly re-add it outside the armer.
 *
 *   The rule scans STRING LITERALS only (single-quoted, double-quoted,
 *   or back-ticked) — comments are exempt because the deletion site
 *   needs prose explaining what was removed and why.
 *
 *   The exempt path is matched by suffix so it bites even before the
 *   armer file lands (Wave 7); pre-existence is not required.
 *
 * Scan root:
 *   --root <dir>  Scan <dir> instead of this checkout. Both surfaces are
 *                 derived from it, so one flag moves the whole scan.
 *                 Defaults to the repository this script ships in, which is
 *                 what `npm run lint` gets by passing nothing.
 *
 *   The seam exists for tests (Story #5052). The CLI test that proves a
 *   violation is *caught* has to plant one, and it used to plant into the
 *   live `.agents/` tree — which `tests/e2e/sync-prune.integration.test.js`
 *   copies with the real binary, so the two raced: the sync either lost the
 *   file between enumeration and `copyfile` (ENOENT) or copied it once and
 *   pruned it on the second pass, tripping an idempotence assertion. Pointing
 *   the planting test at a temp root keeps what that test was written for —
 *   discovery is still the CLI's own walk, not an injected file list — while
 *   leaving the shared tree untouched. Mirrors the `--root` seam
 *   `check-test-temp-hygiene.js` already ships for the same reason.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — clean.
 *   1 — at least one violation; offending file + line printed to stderr.
 *
 * This script ships as part of `npm run lint`. It is intentionally
 * Node-only (no ESLint dependency) because the repo's lint surface is
 * biome + markdownlint; a custom rule fits cleanly alongside.
