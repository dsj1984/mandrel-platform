/**
 * Local full verification — a true CI mirror for the gates that CAN be proven
 * locally, without epic-scoped MI projection or push semantics.
 *
 * Order: audit (SCA) → lint (includes docs:check + the arch-cycles ratchet) →
 * full test suite → unified baselines → the standalone ratchets
 * (dead-exports ×2, context-budget, cyclomatic, schema-references).
 *
 * The `audit` step runs `npm audit --audit-level=high`, matching CI's
 * "Dependency Vulnerability Audit (SCA)" gate so a local green no longer hides
 * a high-severity advisory that CI would fail on. It is independent of the
 * pre-push `PREPUSH_AUDIT` opt-in, which stays unchanged.
 *
 * The trailing ratchets complete the mirror of CI's "Architecture Cycle Check"
 * step in the `baselines` job (Story #4549). That step runs three checks;
 * `check-arch-cycles.js` is deliberately absent from STEPS because the `lint`
 * step above already runs it (see run-lint.js) — re-running it here would
 * double-pay a gate verify already covers. `check-dead-exports.js` and
 * `check-context-budget.js` had no such cover: they were reachable locally only
 * via the diff-scoped `npm run quality:preview` or a direct invocation, so a
 * clean `verify` could still hide a CI-red — the failure Story #4531 / PR #4548
 * paid for with a full push → CI → fix → push round-trip. Both are pure-Node
 * and baseline-aware, adding ~15s on a cold cache (dominated by knip's
 * full-tree scan in check-dead-exports.js) to a command that already carries
 * the full test suite.
 *
 * Story #5004 closed the last two mirror gaps that were pure omission.
 * `check-cyclomatic.js` (#4923) and `check-schema-references.js` (#4938) were
 * each added to the `baselines` job's standalone-ratchet slot without ever
 * being added here, so a green `verify` still hid both. Like their neighbours
 * they are pure-Node and cost milliseconds.
 *
 * Still NOT mirrored: `check-workflow-citations.js` and
 * `check-baseline-scope.js` run in CI's `baselines` job only —
 * `.agents/rules/known-tooling-behavior.md` entry 2 carries the current
 * coverage table. (`prune-baseline-orphans.js --check` used to sit in that
 * list; it no longer runs in CI at all — the un-attributed duplicate of the
 * scope gate's `extra` direction reds every open PR on inherited rows.) Nor are the CI gates this command structurally cannot
 * reproduce (action pinning, TruffleHog secret scan) — those are catalogued
 * in docs/ci-contract.md. The nightly full-scope re-score
 * (.github/workflows/baseline-drift.yml) is deliberately outside this
 * mirror too: it re-scores the whole tree, which is the cost `verify` exists
 * to avoid paying on every run.
