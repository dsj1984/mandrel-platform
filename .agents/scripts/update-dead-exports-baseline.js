/**
 * update-dead-exports-baseline.js — the producer behind the dead-export
 * ratchet (Story #5011).
 *
 * `check-dead-exports.js` has shipped since Story #1852 with no way to write
 * the baseline it ratchets against. Every seed and every refresh was therefore
 * a hand-edit: run the checker with `--json`, copy `currentRows` out of the
 * report, re-sort them, and preserve `$schema` / `kernelVersion` / `mode` by
 * hand. That is the gap this CLI closes — dead-exports now sits beside its four
 * `update-*-baseline.js` siblings instead of being the one baseline an operator
 * had to author in a text editor.
 *
 * **Fail closed, unlike the checker.** `check-dead-exports.js` treats a knip
 * spawn or parse failure as advisory (exit 0 + a stderr warning) because it
 * still holds a committed snapshot to compare against — a broken knip install
 * must not redden CI on its own. The producer has no such fallback: the file it
 * is about to write *is* the snapshot. An empty row set persisted from a failed
 * run would silently grandfather every dead export in the repository and blind
 * the ratchet permanently. So this CLI exits non-zero and writes **nothing**
 * whenever knip cannot run, its report cannot be parsed, or the knip version
 * cannot be resolved. That asymmetry with the checker is deliberate.
 *
 * **Envelope, not the shared writer.** Dead-exports does not route through
 * `lib/baselines/writer.js`: that writer admits only the kinds registered in
 * `lib/baselines/envelope.js` and requires a `*` rollup row, while dead-exports
 * is an out-of-band ratchet kind (`lib/audit-baselines/kinds.js`) that carries
 * no rollup. This CLI writes exactly the shape the checker already reads and
 * both committed baselines already carry:
 *
 *   { $schema, kernelVersion, generatedAt, [mode], rows: [{ file, symbol }] }
 *
 * `kernelVersion` is knip's own installed version — knip is the scorer, so a
 * knip upgrade is what invalidates the rows. `mode` is stamped on the
 * `--production` pass only, matching the committed production baseline.
 *
 * Rows are de-duplicated and sorted by `(file, symbol)` with the same
 * comparator `check-dead-exports.js` uses for its diff output, so a re-run
 * against an unchanged tree differs only in `generatedAt` and review sees real
 * movement rather than reordering noise.
 *
 * The pass is selected with `--production`, and the baseline/label/mode triple
 * comes from `lib/dead-exports-mode.js` — the same resolver the checker uses.
 * Resolving that pairing independently here is precisely how a producer would
 * end up writing production rows over the default baseline.
