/**
 * deliver-recover.js — probe a stranded Story's live state and print the ONE
 * command that resumes it (Story #4543).
 *
 * Read-only by construction. This CLI mutates nothing: it reads the ticket's
 * labels and lease, the Story branch locally and via its tracking ref, the
 * worktree, and the PR (state + checks), then walks a fixed decision table
 * and prints one command with the evidence it was derived from. It never
 * prints a menu — a menu of options is what the operator already has, and it
 * is the thing they cannot act on.
 *
 * The strand this exists for above all others is the **merged-but-label-stale**
 * Story: a `/deliver` re-run refuses it outright, because
 * `single-story-init.js` hard-errors on an already-closed Story. Before this
 * surface, that Story had no automated way back.
 *
 * Every command it prints **resumes** — it re-enters the in-flight worker or
 * close, or closes the branch that is already pushed. None of them re-dispatch
 * the Story, and that is deliberate: since Story #4876 the close-and-land tail
 * belongs to the dispatching orchestrator, so a worker returning without a
 * terminal envelope is the expected shape rather than evidence the Story never
 * ran. Answering it with a fresh dispatch re-runs `single-story-init.js`
 * underneath live work and puts a second close on one PR.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node .agents/scripts/deliver-recover.js --story <STORY_ID> [--cwd <main-repo>]
 *                                           [--json]
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — a recovery shape was resolved and its next command printed (including
 *       the "nothing to recover" shapes). Reading state is not a failure.
 *   1 — the probe itself could not run (unreadable ticket, bad input).
 *

Probes a Story's live delivery state — labels, lease, branch, worktree, PR
state and checks — and prints the single next command that resumes it, with
the evidence it was derived from. Read-only: mutates nothing.

The command always resumes the existing worker or close (or closes an already
pushed branch); it never re-dispatches the Story, which would re-run init
underneath live work. A worker that returned no terminal envelope is expected —
the orchestrator owns the close-and-land tail.

Mid-flight shapes (executing-*/closing-*) get a stability re-probe after a
short settle window: matching shapes return the fresher verdict; diverging
shapes report \`in-transition\` (a live delivery process is mutating the
state) instead of a confidently wrong command.

Flags:
  --story       GitHub issue number of the Story (required).
  --cwd         Main-repo checkout to probe (default: project root).
  --json        Emit the full recovery envelope as JSON instead of prose.
  --no-reprobe  Skip the stability re-probe (single-probe verdict).
  --help        Show this message.
