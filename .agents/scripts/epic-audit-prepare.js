/**
 * epic-audit-prepare.js — Phase 4 prepare CLI for `/deliver`.
 *
 * Thin glue around the audit-suite `selectAudits` SDK. Reads the Epic
 * ticket, runs the change-set selector against the Epic branch diff
 * (`main..epic/<id>`), and emits a JSON envelope on stdout that the
 * inline `helpers/epic-audit.md` consumes.
 *
 * The CLI carries no business logic beyond:
 *   1. validating `--epic <id>`,
 *   2. resolving the Epic branch name (`epic/<id>`),
 *   3. running `selectAudits` at the close-gate (`gate3`),
 *   4. routing the model-judged risk envelope's high-risk axes onto their
 *      mapped audit lenses (Story #3889 — `resolveAuditLenses`) and unioning
 *      them into the change-set selection,
 *   5. resolving the run's audit depth (`light` / `standard` / `deep`) from
 *      the same risk envelope + the change-set's changed-file count via the
 *      shared `resolveDepth` resolver (Story #3939), and
 *   6. shaping the result into the helper-consumable envelope.
 *
 * Story #3939 — depth-aware lenses. The `depth` field tells the audit
 * executor (`helpers/epic-audit.md`) how thorough each selected lens should
 * be on this Epic without ever skipping a selected (or alwaysRun) lens:
 * `light` shrinks a lens's sweep to the changed surface + Critical/High
 * findings, `standard` is today's behavior, and `deep` widens the sweep to
 * the directly-touched modules. Depth never changes which lenses fire, the
 * severity taxonomy, the findings shape, or the Phase 4 halting rule — it is
 * an orthogonal "how deep" signal alongside the "which lenses" selection.
 * Depth is resolved from the SAME best-effort `planningRisk` checkpoint read
 * the risk-routed lenses use (a missing/unparseable checkpoint degrades to
 * `standard`, never an abort) folded with the changed-file count the
 * change-set diff already produces.
 *
 * Story #3889 — risk-routed lenses. Epic #3865 added `resolveAuditLenses`
 * (axis → audit-lens mapping for the model-judged risk verdict) to
 * `lib/orchestration/code-review.js` but nothing invoked it in the live
 * delivery path. This CLI now reads the `planningRisk` envelope off the
 * Epic's `epic-plan-state` checkpoint and unions the routed lenses into
 * `selectedAudits`, so a high-risk Epic auto-runs its mapped lenses
 * (e.g. a `security`-axis Epic runs `audit-security`) at Phase 4 through the
 * SAME `runAuditSuite` / `selectAuditStrategy` engine the helper already
 * dispatches — no new audit machinery. A low-risk Epic routes no extra
 * lenses. Reading the checkpoint is best-effort: a missing/unparseable
 * checkpoint degrades to the change-set selection alone (never an abort).
 *
 * Envelope shape (Tech Spec #2588 — API Changes § New CLI):
 *
 *   {
 *     "epicId": 2586,
 *     "epicBranch": "epic/2586",
 *     "depth": "deep",
 *     "selectedAudits": ["audit-security", "audit-privacy"],
 *     "changeSetAudits": ["audit-privacy"],
 *     "riskRoutedAudits": ["audit-security"],
 *     "globalLenses": [],
 *     "changedFiles": ["src/api/admin/users.ts", "..."],
 *     "changedFilesCount": 47,
 *     "substitutionsPayload": "src/api/admin/users.ts\n..."
 *   }
 *
 * `selectedAudits` is the union the helper dispatches: the change-set
 * selection (`changeSetAudits`) plus the risk-routed lenses
 * (`riskRoutedAudits`), de-duplicated. The two source-of-truth arrays are
 * surfaced for observability so the operator can see why each lens fired.
 * `depth` (`light` / `standard` / `deep`) is the orthogonal "how deep each
 * selected lens runs" signal (Story #3939).
 *
 * Epic #4131 (F2/F3) — `globalLenses` is the subset of `selectedAudits` on the
 * global-lens allowlist (`GLOBAL_LENS_ALLOWLIST`, e.g. `audit-navigability`):
 * lenses the helper runs against the WHOLE route tree, exempt from the
 * cross-epic-leak guard's change-set narrowing (`#3362`). The exemption is
 * scoped to these lenses only — every other selected lens stays scoped to
 * `changedFiles`, and the guard is not weakened for them. The navigability lens
 * is also auto-selected here when a changed file matches a consumer-configured
 * route glob (`delivery.quality.navigability.routeGlobs`), routed through the
 * SAME risk-routed-lens union; with no route globs configured it routes
 * nothing (silent no-op).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node .agents/scripts/epic-audit-prepare.js --epic <epicId> [--base-branch main]
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — envelope written to stdout
 *   2 — validation error (missing/invalid --epic)
 *   1 — provider / git failure
