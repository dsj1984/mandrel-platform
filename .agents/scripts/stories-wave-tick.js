/**
 * stories-wave-tick.js — continuous ready-set planner for the standalone
 * `/deliver` story-list path.
 *
 * Thin **adapter** over the path-agnostic ready-set scheduling core
 * (`lib/wave-runner/ready-set.js#planReadySet`). It emits the set of
 * Stories safe to dispatch **on this beat** — a Story becomes dispatchable
 * the instant its own dependencies are done, under the same global
 * concurrency cap and the same file-overlap co-dispatch guard
 * `lib/wave-runner/ready-set.js` applies everywhere. There is no wave barrier: this no longer batches
 * Stories into fully-draining waves; it selects continuously.
 *
 * The previous static wave-batch plan (group N must fully drain before
 * group N+1 opens, via `Graph.js#assignLayers`) is gone. The scheduling
 * kernel — adjacency derivation, the done-predicate classifier, the
 * eligibility rule, and the overlap guard — lives once in `planReadySet`;
 * this file only gathers input, resolves the cap, and renders the envelope.
 *
 * **Two modes, one kernel.**
 *
 *   - **Probe mode** (`--stories <csv> --probe-live [--dispatched <csv>]`) is
 *     the canonical `/deliver` beat: the graph, the done set, and the in-flight
 *     count are resolved from **live state** via `lib/wave-runner/live-probe.js`.
 *     The caller supplies ids, so there is no accounting to hand-maintain
 *     across beats — the seed-the-first-beat's-`--done` footgun the workflow
 *     used to warn about is structurally impossible rather than merely
 *     documented. `--dispatched` is the one fact live state cannot yet report
 *     ("I spawned this id; its label has not appeared"); it is additive and
 *     live-state-filtered, never authoritative (Story #4601).
 *   - **Flag mode** (`--dag`/`--dag-file` + `--done`/`--in-flight`) keeps the
 *     caller-supplied contract byte-compatible for tests and hand-driven
 *     runs. The two are mutually exclusive: honouring a supplied `--done`
 *     under `--probe-live` would silently reintroduce exactly the
 *     hand-maintained state probe mode retires.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node .agents/scripts/stories-wave-tick.js --stories 101,102 --probe-live
 *   node .agents/scripts/stories-wave-tick.js --dag '<json>'
 *   node .agents/scripts/stories-wave-tick.js --dag-file <path>
 *   node .agents/scripts/stories-wave-tick.js --dag '<json>' --concurrency 5
 *   node .agents/scripts/stories-wave-tick.js --dag '<json>' --done 101,103 --in-flight 1
 *
 * DAG input format (JSON):
 *   Array of { id: number, dependsOn: number[] } objects where id is a Story
 *   ticket number and dependsOn lists Story IDs that must complete first.
 *
 * Output: one JSON object on stdout with shape:
 *   {
 *     kind: 'stories-ready-set',
 *     ready: number[],          // Story IDs safe to dispatch on this beat
 *     totalStories: number,
 *     concurrencyCap: number,
 *     inFlight: number,
 *     cycleError: string | null,
 *     wedged: { reason, stories: [{ id, unmetBlockers }] } | null,
 *     inFlightReservation: { available, withheld: [{ id, blockedBy, reason }], note }
 *   }
 *
 * `inFlightReservation` reports the cross-beat half of the co-dispatch guard
 * (Story #4875 widened the footprint; Story #4950 made it reserve). Under
 * `--probe-live` the in-flight Stories' own records are handed to the kernel,
 * so a candidate sharing a CONCRETE path with a Story dispatched on an EARLIER
 * beat is withheld and named here with its blocker and a `reason`
 * (`in-flight-earlier-beat` or `foreign-lease`). A glob / UNKNOWN footprint
 * reserves nothing across beats — it would withhold the whole run for one
 * blocker's entire implementation window — while still serializing its own
 * beat (Story #4960). Flag mode carries a count and no records, so it reports
 * `available: false` rather than an empty — and therefore indistinguishable —
 * result.
 *
 * Probe mode adds fields the caller can no longer compute for itself:
 * `done: number[]` (the resolved done set, in-set ∪ satisfied foreign
 * blockers), `epilogueDue: boolean` (true exactly when every listed Story
 * is done — the run-end signal for `plan-run-epilogue.js`), and `blocked:
 * number[]` + `blockedReason: string|null` (Story #4601 — the `agent::blocked`
 * HITL pause, which ends the loop rather than being polled).
 *
 * The standalone loop calls this once per beat and dispatches the returned
 * `ready` set (already capped at `concurrencyCap − inFlight` by the core).
 * Under `--probe-live` each beat re-reads reality, so the run is complete
 * when `epilogueDue` is true; under flag mode the caller re-supplies `--done`
 * and `--in-flight` itself, and the run is complete when every Story is in
 * `--done` and `ready` is empty.
 *
 * The per-beat concurrency cap is resolved from the same config seam
 * `/deliver` uses — `resolveConfig` + `getRunners` reading
 * `delivery.deliverRunner.concurrencyCap` (default 3) — so a
 * `.agentrc.local.json` override is honored. A `--concurrency <n>` CLI flag
 * overrides the config-resolved value for that run only, and the envelope's
 * `capPrecedence` names which source won so the override is never silent
 * (Story #4875). This shares one
 * deterministic config source (`delivery.deliverRunner.concurrencyCap`) and
 * one scheduling kernel with every `/deliver` multi-Story invocation.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 input error · 2 dependency cycle (`cycleError`) ·
 * 3 wedged (`wedged`) — ready is empty, nothing is in flight, and undone
 * Stories are waiting on blockers that are not done · 4 blocked (`blocked`) —
 * a Story carries `agent::blocked`. A cycle is a self-referential DAG the
 * operator must fix; a wedge is a well-formed DAG whose gates cannot be
 * satisfied from the supplied `--done` set (usually a blocker outside the
 * delivered set that has not landed); a block is the protocol's HITL pause,
 * where a human owes a decision no beat can supply. All three are distinct
 * from the ordinary `ready: []` that means "waiting on in-flight work" — and
 * that distinction is the point: each of them previously presented AS that
 * ordinary empty set, so the loop polled a state that could never improve.

Continuous ready-set planner for standalone Story delivery. Emits the set of
Stories safe to dispatch on this beat — a Story is dispatchable the instant
its own dependencies are done — plus the resolved per-beat concurrency cap
and the same file-overlap guard as planReadySet.

Two modes:
  --probe-live  Resolve the graph and derive done / in-flight from LIVE state
                (the canonical /deliver beat). Nothing is hand-maintained
                across beats. Mutually exclusive with --dag/--dag-file/--done/
                --in-flight. Adds "done" and "epilogueDue" to the envelope.
  --dag         Legacy flag mode: the caller supplies the graph and the run
                progress. Kept for tests and hand-driven runs.

Input DAG format (JSON array):
  [{ "id": 101, "dependsOn": [] }, { "id": 102, "dependsOn": [101] }]

Each entry must include:
  id         - Story ticket number (positive integer)
  dependsOn  - Array of Story IDs that must complete before this Story runs

Options:
  --stories <csv>    Story ids to deliver (probe mode). Singles or inclusive
                     A-B ranges (101,104-107). The graph, the done set, and
                     the in-flight count are resolved from live state — no
                     --done / --in-flight bookkeeping.
  --probe-live       Enable probe mode. Requires --stories.
  --dispatched <csv> Probe mode only. Ids you have SPAWNED this run. Unioned
                     into the live-derived in-flight set, then filtered by
                     live state, so it closes the init window: a Story reads
                     agent::ready for the 3-6 minutes single-story-init.js
                     takes to flip agent::executing, and without this it is
                     dispatched a second time onto the same branch. Append
                     every id you dispatch and never remove one — a stale id
                     that has since gone done is dropped automatically, so
                     over-supplying is free and forgetting is the only error.
  --concurrency <n>  Override the per-beat concurrency cap for this run only.
                     Must be a positive integer. When omitted, the cap is
                     resolved from delivery.deliverRunner.concurrencyCap in
                     .agentrc.json / .agentrc.local.json (default 3). The flag
                     WINS over the configured value, and the envelope's
                     capPrecedence records that it did — including when the
                     request exceeds the configured cap.
  --done <csv>       Comma-separated Story IDs already completed this run.
                     Their dependents become eligible; they are never
                     re-dispatched. Defaults to empty.
  --in-flight <n>    Count of Stories already occupying a slot (dispatched
                     but not yet done). Subtracted from the cap to compute
                     remaining capacity. Non-negative integer; defaults to 0.

Output envelope:
  {
    "kind": "stories-ready-set",
    "ready": [101],
    "totalStories": 2,
    "concurrencyCap": 3,
    "capPrecedence": {
      "cap": 3,
      "source": "config",
      "configuredCap": 3,
      "requestedCap": null,
      "exceedsConfigured": false,
      "note": "..."
    },
    "inFlight": 0,
    "cycleError": null,
    "wedged": null,
    "inFlightReservation": {
      "available": true,
      "withheld": [{ "id": 4951, "blockedBy": 4949 }],
      "note": "..."
    }
  }

inFlightReservation names each Story withheld this beat because its file
footprint overlaps one still IN FLIGHT from an earlier beat, together with the
blocking id — so an unfilled slot is explained rather than mysterious. It needs
the in-flight Stories' footprints, which only --probe-live has: under --dag the
report is { available: false } and selection de-conflicts within the beat only.

Exit codes:
  0 - Success, ready set emitted
  1 - Invalid input (missing/malformed DAG, invalid --concurrency/--in-flight/--done)
  2 - Cycle detected in dependency graph
  3 - Wedged: ready is empty, nothing is in flight, and undone Stories are
      waiting on blockers that are not done. Distinct from an ordinary empty
      ready set (which means "waiting on in-flight work") and from a cycle.
  4 - Blocked: a Story carries agent::blocked (probe mode only). The HITL
      pause — no beat can clear it. STOP the loop; do not poll.

 *
 *   - **Probe mode** hands over the records `live-probe.js` already fetched,
