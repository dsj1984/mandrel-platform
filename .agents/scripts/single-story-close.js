/**
 * single-story-close.js — Close a Story against `main` (v2 `/mandrel-deliver` path).
 *
 * Thin CLI entry for `/mandrel-deliver` / `helpers/deliver-story`. Opens a PR from
 * `story-<id>` to `project.baseBranch`, runs Story-scope review, and arms
 * auto-merge. There is no Epic parent, epic-merge-lock, or wave merge.
 *
 * Pipeline (each step is a phase under
 * `./lib/orchestration/single-story-close/phases/`):
 *
 *   1. close-validation  — canonical gate chain against `baseBranch`
 *   2. base-sync         — `origin/<baseBranch>` → Story branch (Story #2580)
 *   3. push              — `git push -u` the Story branch
 *   4. pull-request      — `gh pr list` probe + `gh pr create`
 *   5. code-review       — Story-scope review (Epic #2815 / Story #2839)
 *   6. auto-merge        — `gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch`
 *   7. label flip + notify — Story → `agent::closing` (Story #3385; the
 *                          `agent::done` flip + issue-close is deferred to
 *                          the post-merge confirmation step,
 *                          `single-story-confirm-merge.js`)
 *   8. worktree-reap     — drop the per-Story worktree
 *   9. confirm-merge      — close-and-land (Story #4428; the DEFAULT for
 *                          every run since `delivery.routing.closeAndLand`):
 *                          poll the just-armed PR to merge confirmation
 *                          (reusing `confirmStoryMerged`), capture the
 *                          Story follow-ups, or terminate `agent::blocked`
 *                          with a classified `merge.unlanded` event — or
 *                          `merge.flip-failed` when the merge landed and
 *                          only the label write failed. Skipped when the
 *                          operator owns the merge (`--no-wait-merge`,
 *                          `--no-auto-merge`, or `autoMerge: "strict"`),
 *                          which rests at `agent::closing` for the human.
 *
 * Existing tests import the re-exported helpers
 * (`runSingleStoryClose`, `ensurePullRequest`, `parsePrNumber`,
 * `enableAutoMerge`, `handleSyncFailure`, `buildSyncFailureCommentBody`,
 * `runStoryScopeReview`, `buildStoryReviewCrossRefBody`) from this file.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node single-story-close.js --story <STORY_ID> [--cwd <main-repo>]
 *                              [--skip-validation] [--skip-sync]
 *                              [--no-auto-merge]
 *                              [--wait-merge | --no-wait-merge]
 *                              [--merge-watch-mode <sync|async>]
 *                              [--override-review-block <reason>]
 *
 * `--override-review-block <reason>` is the one sanctioned way
 * past a code-review CRITICAL blocker. A critical finding halts this script
 * before auto-merge, and until this flag existed there was no override at all —
 * so an operator who had read a finding and judged it wrong could only land by
 * running `gh pr merge` themselves, bypassing the gate with nothing written
 * down. The flag does not weaken the gate; it moves that escape hatch into a
 * mandatory-reason audit trail (Story comment + PR comment + a
 * `review-block-overridden` friction signal) and reports
 * `gates.codeReview: "overridden"` on the terminal envelope. A bare or
 * too-short reason fails during option parsing, before any phase runs.
 *
 * `--merge-watch-mode` (Story #4949) overrides `delivery.mergeWatch.mode` for
 * one invocation, on the same explicit-wins-over-config precedence
 * `--max-wait-seconds` uses, and the two compose. It exists because run
 * topology is invisible from inside close: a solo delivery is cheapest waiting
 * in the foreground, while the Nth close of a wave pays that wait as
 * serialized dead time. The config default therefore stays `sync` and the
 * orchestrator — the only party that knows N — passes `async` per close. An
 * unrecognized value fails during option parsing, before any phase runs.
 *
 * Close-and-land is the DEFAULT for every run (Story #4428 introduced it as
 * `--wait-merge`; `delivery.routing.closeAndLand` — default `true` — made it
 * the default, and Story #4539 made that knob actually readable). Resolution
 * order, highest first: `--no-wait-merge` (explicit opt-out, always wins);
 * operator-owns-the-merge (`--no-auto-merge` or `delivery.ci.autoMerge:
 * "strict"` — the PR was deliberately left un-armed, so there is nothing to
 * land and the Story rests at `agent::closing`); explicit `--wait-merge`;
 * then the config. A genuine arm FAILURE is not an opt-out — it still waits
 * and therefore still blocks, which is what keeps the must-land contract
 * intact.
 *
 * Every invocation emits ONE schema-validated terminal envelope
 * (`.agents/schemas/story-deliver-terminal.schema.json`, Story #4543) on
 * stdout between `--- STORY DELIVER TERMINAL ---` markers. Its `status` is
 * the contract; the exit code mirrors it:
 *
 *   0 — `landed`:  the PR merged, the Story is `agent::done`, and the
 *                  post-land tail ran (follow-ups, status resync, local ref
 *                  cleanup, base fast-forward).
 *   3 — `pending`: RESUMABLE, not a failure. Either the per-invocation merge
 *                  wait (`delivery.mergeWatch.maxWaitSeconds`, default 300s
 *                  to fit a single host tool invocation) expired with the PR
 *                  still healthy and in flight, or the operator owns the
 *                  merge (`--no-wait-merge` / `--no-auto-merge` /
 *                  `autoMerge: "strict"`). NO label was mutated and no
 *                  `merge.unlanded` event was emitted. The envelope's
 *                  `nextCommand` names the single command that resumes it,
 *                  and the cumulative budget is anchored at the PR's
 *                  createdAt so the resume does not restart the clock.
 *   1 — `blocked` or `failed`: a classified hard block (the Story carries
 *                  `agent::blocked` and a friction comment) or a phase crash.
 *
 * The distinct `pending` code is the point: before it, a close-and-land whose
 * CI outlived the host's tool-invocation ceiling was killed mid-poll with no
 * terminal path taken at all, and merely shrinking the budget instead would
 * have misfiled every slow-CI run as a hard block.

/**
 * CLI entry — resolves the process exit code from the terminal envelope's

 * (resumable) is distinguishable from `blocked` (come look) without parsing
 * stdout.
 *
 * The catch parses argv through the **non-throwing** wrapper (Story #4959).
 * It used to call `parseSprintArgs()` — re-invoking the very parser that had
 * just thrown, since `parseMergeWatchMode` made argv parsing fallible. The
 * second throw escaped the handler, so an unparseable argv produced a bare
 * stack trace with no envelope and no friction signal, on the surface whose
 * whole contract is that every invocation emits exactly one envelope. An
 * error handler may not depend on an operation already known to fail.
 *
 * A parse rejection carries no `closePhase`, so the envelope reports `init` —
 * accurate: the runner rejected the flag before any phase ran, and nothing
 * was mutated.
