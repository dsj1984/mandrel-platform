// .agents/scripts/prune-plan-run-labels.js — Story #5189.
//
// Sweep the repository's `plan-run::<id>` cohort labels and delete the ones
// that are provably spent.
//
// The close tail reaps incrementally — one Story's own labels, as it lands —
// which keeps a healthy repository flat but does nothing about a pile that
// already exists, and nothing about a cohort whose last Story was closed by
// hand rather than by a close. This is the surface that burns an accumulated
// pile down: it reads the whole label vocabulary through the paginating
// listing port, so what it can see is bounded by the repository rather than by
// an API page.
//
// The decision is not made here — `lib/orchestration/plan-run-labels/reap.js`
// owns it, so this sweep and the close-path reap cannot come to different
// conclusions about when a label is spent. In short: reapable means the label
// carries at least one issue and every one of them is closed. A label carrying
// zero issues is NOT reapable by default, because that shape is exactly what
// an in-flight `plan-persist` looks like between minting its label and
// creating its Stories; `--include-unreferenced` is the explicit opt-in for an
// operator who knows no persist is running.
//
// Exit codes:
//   0  nothing reapable (or, without `--check`, the reap was performed)
//   1  `--check` found at least one label that would be reaped
//   2  the sweep could not run

// Fail-fast if the framework's runtime deps are not installed — must be the
// first import so the check runs before any third-party-importing sibling
// module is evaluated (Story #3432).
