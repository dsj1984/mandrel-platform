/**
 * update-duplication-baseline.js — manual refresh CLI for the
 * code-duplication (DRY) baseline (Story #3664).
 *
 * Story #4944: this CLI is now a thin wrapper around
 * `refreshBaseline({ kind: 'duplication' })` from
 * `.agents/scripts/lib/baselines/refresh-service.js`, completing the Epic
 * #2173 migration — duplication was the last kind still assembling its own
 * writer call via the legacy `buildWriterScopeArgs` path. Scope resolution,
 * prior-envelope reading, epsilon damping, envelope assembly, and
 * persistence all flow through the unified service.
 *
 * The migration is what makes this CLI's documented surface true. Before it,
 * `--full-scope` was advertised and parsed by nobody, and the no-flag default
 * was a full rewrite rather than the diff-scoped refresh the usage text
 * described.
 *
 * Surface:
 *
 *   - `--baseline <path>`: write somewhere other than the configured
 *     `delivery.quality.gates.duplication.baselinePath`.
 *   - `--diff-scope <ref>`: scope the refresh to files changed between
 *     `<ref>` and HEAD. Out-of-scope rows are preserved verbatim from the
 *     prior on-disk baseline.
 *   - `--full-scope`: regenerate every row (no out-of-scope merge).
 *   - With no scope flag: scope is derived from `git diff --name-only
 *     origin/main..HEAD` (the service's default `baseRef..headRef`), matching
 *     `update-crap-baseline.js` / `update-maintainability-baseline.js` /
 *     `update-coverage-baseline.js`.
 *
 * **Scope is a write-side filter here, not a scan-side one.** jscpd detects
 * clones pairwise, so the scan always covers the whole target tree even in
 * diff mode — see `buildDefaultDuplicationScorer` in the refresh service for
 * why narrowing the scan would drop clones between a changed file and an
 * unchanged one. What a scope flag narrows is which rows the refresh is
 * allowed to rewrite.
 *
 * Exits non-zero only when the scanner itself crashes. An empty result (no
 * detected clones) still writes an envelope with `rows: []` so downstream
 * `check-baselines` can tell "intentional empty baseline" apart from "no
 * baseline yet".
