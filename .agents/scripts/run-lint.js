 * A Node gate spelled `node .agents/scripts/<script>` — the shape six of the
 * eight tasks share. Spelling it once keeps this list readable as what it
 * actually is (a fan-out roster) instead of a wall of spawn tuples, and keeps
 * adding a gate from costing the module a maintainability regression for the
 * boilerplate rather than the behaviour. Mirrors `run-verify.js`'s `gate()`.
 *
 * Use bare `node` (PATH-resolved) rather than `process.execPath`:
 * `process.execPath` on Windows often expands to `C:\Program
 * Files\nodejs\node.exe`, and spawn(..., { shell: true }) does not quote the
 * executable, so the space breaks invocation.
 *
 * The path is passed WHOLE rather than assembled from a basename. Composing
 * it (`` `.agents/scripts/${script}` ``) reads better and is wrong:
 * `check-knip-entries.js` derives which CLIs something actually invokes by
 * scanning this file's source text for literal script paths, and four of the
 * gates below are invoked from nowhere else. Interpolating the path made them
 * invisible to that derivation, so knip called them dead and the ratchet
 * offered to record live gates as expected-dead — the Story #5012 trap.
 *
 * @param {string} name reported in this driver's own error prefix
 * @param {string} script repo-relative path, spelled as one literal
 * @returns {{ name: string, cmd: string, args: string[] }}
