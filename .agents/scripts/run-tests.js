/**
 * Cross-platform driver for `npm test`.
 *
 * npm lifecycle `posttest` scripts only run after a successful `test` script.
 * This wrapper keeps cleanup in the same process path as the Node test runner
 * so reserved test temp artefacts are removed even when tests fail.
 *
 * Webhook scrub: the test child inherits an environment where
 * `NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL` is unset and `NODE_ENV=test`. Operators keep a
 * real webhook URL in `.env` for development (resolveConfig loads it into
 * process.env); without this scrub, any test that transitively reaches
 * `notify()` POSTs to the live endpoint. Set `MANDREL_ALLOW_TEST_WEBHOOKS=1`
 * to opt back in for the rare case where a contract test deliberately
 * exercises a sandbox endpoint.
 *
 * Windows arg-length safety: every tier enumerates explicit test-file
 * targets. `quick` / `integration` always did (they exclude specific slow
 * suites, so a single glob will not do), and `full` joined them in Story
 * #5111 — `node --test` has no negative pattern, so "everything except
 * `tests/e2e/**`" is only sayable as a file set. With ~700+ targets the
 * joined command line crosses the Windows `CreateProcess` ~32 767-char
 * `lpCommandLine` ceiling, and `spawnSync` throws `ENAMETOOLONG` before a
 * single test runs. To stay safe on every platform the runner partitions the
 * targets into chunks whose joined length stays well under that ceiling
 * (`MAX_TARGET_CHARS`) and spawns one `node --test` process per chunk,
 * aggregating the exit codes. On POSIX the far larger
 * `POSIX_MAX_TARGET_CHARS` budget collapses every tier back into one spawn.

 * quoting). Budgeting the targets to 8 000 chars keeps every spawn's full
 * command line at roughly a quarter of the ceiling — ample headroom for the
 * exe path and any pass-through `--test-name-pattern` args — while keeping
 * the chunk count (and thus the extra `node` start-ups) low.
 *
 * `MAX_TARGET_CHARS` is the **Windows** budget. On POSIX hosts `ARG_MAX` is
 * far higher (~256 KB on macOS, ~1 MB on Linux), so applying the Windows
 * budget there needlessly serializes the quick tier into several sequential
 * `node --test` spawns — each chunk pays a fresh runner start-up, and cores
 * idle at every chunk's tail. `POSIX_MAX_TARGET_CHARS` (100 000) lets the
 * whole quick-tier target list (~33 000 chars today) collapse into a single
 * spawn on POSIX while staying far below `ARG_MAX`.
 * `resolveMaxTargetChars` picks the budget per platform; the Windows
 * semantics of `MAX_TARGET_CHARS` are unchanged.

  --test-name-pattern <re>, --test-only
                        The documented \`node --test\` pass-throughs, forwarded
                        verbatim in flag position, ahead of the file targets.
                        Any other \`--flag\` is rejected rather than forwarded:
                        \`node --test\` reads an unrecognized flag as another

preflight refuses to start the suite.
