// .agents/scripts/check-knip-entries.js — the guard #5001 left unbuilt.
//
// Story #5001 made two changes that are individually right and jointly unsafe:
// it replaced knip's blanket `.agents/scripts/*.js!` entry glob with an
// explicit list (so an uninvoked CLI surfaces as dead), and it promoted knip's
// `files` rule to `error` (so whole-file death produces baseline rows). The
// explicit list is hand-maintained; nothing checked it.
//
// So any CLI added after #5001 is, by default, invisible to knip: absent from
// the entry list, it reads as unreachable, emits a `{ file, symbol: '*' }` row,
// and drags every lib module only it imports into the dead set with it. Story
// #5012 hit exactly this — 5 false rows — and the ratchet's natural remedy
// (accept the diff) would have written live operator CLIs into
// `baselines/dead-exports-production.json` as expected-dead, permanently. It
// was caught by luck: a base-sync conflict forced a manual read of the diff.
//
// This gate removes the luck. It derives the invoked set from the executable
// surfaces #5001's own acceptance criterion named — package.json scripts, husky
// hooks, `.github/workflows`, `.agents` workflow/skill/agent/rule markdown, and
// script-to-script spawns — and asserts it matches the entry array of whatever
// configuration knip itself would load, in both directions. See
// `lib/knip-entry-sync.js` for why liveness means *invoked* rather than
// *present*, and why documentation prose does not count.
//
// Analysis-free by construction: knip's config resolver is loaded (a
// `knip.config.ts` has to be evaluated, not parsed), but nothing is scanned —
// no knip run, no scorer, no coverage artifact. Past that it is a directory
// read and a handful of regexes, which is what keeps it cheap enough to sit in
// the required-check set next to `check-baseline-scope.js`.
//
// Not-applicable is not failure (Story #5039). A repository with no knip
// configuration at all — and one where `knip` is not installed — exits 0 with a
// skip line, the same opt-in posture `qa.gherkinLint` uses. Without that, the
// gate could not be wired into a consumer that does not run knip, and #5001's
// guard stayed unbuilt everywhere it was most needed. A configuration that
// EXISTS but cannot be resolved still exits 2: absence and breakage are
// different answers.
//
// Exit codes:
//   0  entry list matches the invoked set, or there is no configuration to check
//   1  divergence — a missing, stale, phantom, or unsuffixed entry
//   2  the check could not run (unresolvable configuration, unusable repository)
