/**
 * pr-watch-with-update.js — the single CI-watch mechanism for the Story
 * delivery path (`helpers/deliver-story.md` Step 4). Story #4358 retired
 * the bare `gh pr checks --watch` so every caller drives this one CLI.
 *
 * Polls the PR's required checks to a terminal state and auto-recovers
 * from `mergeStateStatus: BEHIND` (via bounded `gh pr update-branch`
 * calls) by delegating to the `watchPrToTerminal` primitive in
 * `lib/orchestration/pr-watch.js`. That primitive was shared with the
 * `Watcher` bus listener until Story #5006 deleted it (nothing emitted at
 * it); this CLI is now its only caller. Story #5024 retired the bus
 * outright, so there is no bus to create — this is a direct, synchronous
 * watch with a real exit code.
 *
 * Slow-vs-failed semantics (Story #4358):
 *   - GREEN — every required check terminal + green → exit 0, unless the
 *             no-rerun guard says otherwise (below).
 *   - RED   — one or more required checks genuinely failed → exit 1
 *             IMMEDIATELY, consuming no resume budget. On red the CLI
 *             disarms native auto-merge and writes
 *             `temp/story-<id>-ci-digest.{json,md}` (failing check name,
 *             head SHA, run id + run link, a `gh run view --log-failed`
 *             tail, and a coarse classification). The digest is scoped by
 *             filename, so it requires `--story` (Story #4539: the digest
 *             was Epic-scoped and therefore never written on the only
 *             delivery path v2 has).
 *   - STILL-RUNNING — the poll cap fired with checks still pending and
 *             none failed; the watcher re-armed up to
 *             `delivery.ci.watch.maxResumes` times, then returned a
 *             `still-running` verdict → exit 2 (NEVER 1, NEVER
 *             `timed_out`). The CLI prints the `gh pr checks --watch`
 *             handoff so the host can keep polling on its own cadence.
 *   - UNRESOLVED — every observed required check is green but the observed
 *             set does not reconcile with the repository's own verdict
 *             (Story #4873) → exit 2, same "keep watching" semantics as
 *             still-running. Withholding is the point: this watcher has
 *             reported green on a PR GitHub was reporting as BLOCKED.
 *   - NOT-YET-STARTED — the attach window was spent and NO required context
 *             ever attached, while the pull request itself kept reading back
 *             fine (Story #4890) → exit 2, the same "keep watching"
 *             semantics. This used to map onto the red exit code, which
 *             misroutes the caller twice over: the module reserves exit 1 for
 *             a required check that GENUINELY FAILED, and the red path writes
 *             a CI digest naming the failing check — so a caller routed onto
 *             it by a set that was merely empty found nothing to read. A
 *             still-empty required set is a slow condition, and the module
 *             already models slow as exit 2. A `gh` fault the PR probe cannot
 *             see past is still exit 1.
 *
 * Two GitHub oracles are deliberately not trusted on a single reading
 * (Story #4873). An EMPTY `gh pr checks --required` probe is re-resolved
 * within {@link REQUIRED_CONTEXT_ATTACH_WINDOW_MS} before it is believed —
 * a ruleset attaches its required contexts asynchronously, and a required
 * context that is an aggregator job gated on every other tier is by
 * construction the LAST to appear (#4890 measured 16m52s), so a watch launched
 * right after `gh pr create` used to fail a delivery whose CI had not been
 * asked to start yet. And a GREEN verdict is issued only after
 * {@link reconcileGreenVerdict} confirms the repository agrees; an
 * unreconcilable set reports unresolved instead of green.
 *
 * No-rerun enforcement (Story #4865). `rules/ci-remediation.md` § Verifier
 * forbids re-running a failed job to reach green; this CLI is the point
 * that enforces it. Enforcement acts on the **first red** — GitHub's native
 * auto-merge fires server-side and races any post-green detection, so a
 * green can already have merged by the time it is observed. On red the
 * watcher disarms auto-merge and records the head SHA; on green it reads
 * the digest and adjudicates: a green on the SAME head SHA is a forbidden
 * re-run (exit 1, `agent::blocked`, `meta::framework-gap` required), while
 * a green on a NEW head SHA is a fix at source — the digest is retired,
 * auto-merge is re-armed, and the delivery proceeds. A delivery that never
 * went red has no digest and is untouched. Mechanism:
 * `lib/orchestration/ci-rerun-guard.js`.
 *
 * Config (Story #4356 namespace, read via `getCiDelivery`):
 *   - `delivery.ci.watch.pollIntervalMs`
 *   - `delivery.ci.watch.maxPolls`
 *   - `delivery.ci.watch.maxResumes`
 *   - `delivery.ci.watch.attachWindowMs` (Story #4890)
 *   CLI flags override config; config overrides the framework fallback.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node .agents/scripts/pr-watch-with-update.js --pr <n> --story <id>
 *     [--repo owner/repo] [--max-updates N] [--poll-interval-ms MS]
 *     [--max-polls N] [--max-resumes N] [--attach-window-ms MS]
