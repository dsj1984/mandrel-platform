/**
 * resolve-stories.js — resolve a list of Story ids into the
 * `{ stories, dag, done }` envelope `/deliver` sequences from.
 *
 * This is the ONE resolution step for multi-Story delivery. `/deliver` takes
 * only Story ids; the graph is discovered here, from live state, rather than
 * hand-transcribed by the host or implied by a batch label.
 *
 * What it resolves, per Story:
 *   - the issue itself, fetched with **state=all** so an already-landed
 *     sibling is present rather than silently dropped;
 *   - its dependency edges: the union of body-parsed `blocked by #N` /
 *     `depends on #N` and native GitHub `blocked_by` edges;
 *   - its declared file footprint, as plain path strings, so the scheduler's
 *     co-dispatch overlap guard has something to work with.
 *
 * And across the set: every dependency id — inside the requested set or
 * foreign to it — is checked against live issue state, and a blocker that is
 * closed or `agent::done` lands in `done[]`. That is what makes "deliver
 * Stories across plan runs and over time" work: a Story whose blocker merged
 * weeks ago in a different run is simply ready.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node .agents/scripts/resolve-stories.js --ids 101,102
 *   node .agents/scripts/resolve-stories.js --ids 101,102 --pretty
 *   node .agents/scripts/resolve-stories.js --ids 101 --no-native   # skip the dependencies API
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 usage/resolution error.

  resolve-stories.js --ids <n,n,...> [--pretty] [--no-native]

Resolve Story ids into the { stories, dag, done } envelope /deliver sequences
from. Dependencies are discovered from live state: body edges union native
blocked_by edges, with every blocker (in-set or foreign) resolved against its
real issue state.

Options:
  --ids <csv>    Comma-separated Story issue numbers. Required.
  --pretty       Pretty-print the JSON envelope.
  --no-native    Skip the native blocked_by read (body edges only).
  --help         Show this help.
