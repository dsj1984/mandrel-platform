/**
 * coverage-capture-usage.js — the `--help` spec for `coverage-capture.js`
 * (Story #5063).
 *
 * The delivery workflow invokes `coverage-capture.js` by name
 * (`helpers/deliver-story-reference.md` § Step 1), which brings it under the
 * workflow-invoked self-description contract enforced by
 * `tests/enforcement/workflow-script-help.test.js`. It failed that contract:
 * `--help` fell through to the capture path and spawned the whole coverage
 * suite instead of describing the script.
 *
 * The spec lives here rather than inline for the same reason
 * `coverage-capture-incremental.js` does — a same-file expansion of the CLI
 * shell costs maintainability index on a file already near its floor, and a
 * usage table is data, not decision logic.
