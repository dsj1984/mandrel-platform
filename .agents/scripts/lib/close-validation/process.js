/**
 * Pipe a child stream's output line-by-line through `emit`, prepending

 * `end` so the operator never loses the last line of a gate's output.
 *
 * ## The drain must stay cheap (Story #4766)
 *
 * This handler runs on the reader side of the child's stdout/stderr pipe.
 * Every microsecond spent here is a microsecond the pipe is not being read,
 * and once the OS pipe buffer fills, the child's own write blocks — or, on a
 * non-blocking pipe, fails outright with `EAGAIN`. A gate child is not
 * obliged to survive that: Biome's `biome_console` `.unwrap()`s the error and
 * aborts the process with exit 101, so a green lint verdict presents as a
 * failed close. Two consequences bind everything on this path:
 *
 *   1. Splitting is O(chunk), not O(chunk × lines) — the scan advances a
 *      `start` index instead of re-slicing the buffer once per line, so a
 *      64KB chunk carrying 500 lines does not copy 16MB.
 *   2. **`emit` MUST NOT block.** A synchronous per-line file write is
 *      exactly the stall this path cannot afford; the close path's capture
 *      sink (`single-story-close/gate-log.js`) buffers to an async stream for
 *      that reason.
