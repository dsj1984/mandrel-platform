 * test-failure signalling under c8. When CRAP is on but `test:coverage` is
 * absent, coverage-capture is dropped and the `test` gate is restored so
 * there is always a working test gate.
 *
 * `typecheck` is mandatory; consumers may customise the command via
 * `project.commands.typecheck` (default `npm run typecheck`).
 *
 * Story #2210 retired the legacy per-kind in-process regression gates
 * (`check-maintainability`, `check-crap`, `check-mutation`) and their
 * shared in-process runner. The unified `check-baselines` gate is now the
 * single source of truth for per-kind regression enforcement
 * (attribution-wired floor + tolerance + schema).
 * The `baseBranch` parameter threads the close run's integration branch
 * into two gates: the `format` gate's `changedFileScope` (existing) and —
 * since Story #3890 — the `check-baselines` gate's `BASELINE_REF` env, so
 * the baselines regression compare diffs head against the epic integration
 * branch (`origin/<baseBranch>`) rather than the framework-default
 * `origin/main`. Without this, every child Story on an `epic/<id>` branch
 * re-discovered inherited main-vs-epic drift in untouched files as phantom
 * regressions and worked around it by hand-setting `BASELINE_REF`.
 *
 * Story #4473 — the coverage-capture gate spawns `npm run test:coverage`,
 * so it is registered ONLY when the consumer actually ships that script.
 * When CRAP is enabled but `test:coverage` is absent, coverage-capture is
 * dropped and the plain `test` gate is restored (see `buildTestGateEntry`),
 * so a consumer without a coverage script gets a working degraded test gate
 * instead of a deterministic close failure with no test gate at all. The
 * probe reads `package.json` at `cwd` (the gate execution directory).
 *
 * Story #4495 — the unified `check-baselines` gate reads a committed
 * `baselines/<kind>.json` for each enabled kind; a consumer that enables
 * baseline gates but ships no `baselines/` tree (every bench sandbox, any
 * greenfield consumer) failed the gate deterministically on first try. The
 * gate is now registered only when its consumer contract is satisfied
 * (`probeBaselinesGate`): at least one enabled kind carries a committed
 * baseline, OR the consumer opted into fail-closed enforcement via
 * `delivery.quality.requireBaselines`. When no baselines are committed and
 * none are required, the gate is skipped with a logged reason (via `log`)
 * instead of a blocking failure.
