/**
 * Reusable audit-lens orchestration engine (Epic #3597, Story #3609).
 *
 * Every audit lens that runs as a Claude Code **dynamic workflow**
 * (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/workflows) shares the same three-phase
 * fan-out:
 *
 *   1. **analyze** — one read-only sub-agent per analysis dimension, run in
 *      parallel, each producing raw findings for its dimension only.
 *   2. **adversarial cross-check** — an independent read-only reviewer
 *      re-verifies each dimension's findings, dropping false positives.
 *   3. **synthesize** — a single agent assembles the cross-checked findings
 *      into the lens's report contract and writes the artifact.
 *
 * Before this engine existed, each lens (starting with `audit-clean-code`)
 * inlined a private copy of this loop. `runAuditOrchestration` extracts it
 * once so a lens workflow only has to declare *what* is lens-specific —
 * its dimension list, its prompt builders, its read-only tool allowlist, and
 * its report-contract self-check — and delegate the fan-out plumbing here.
 *
 * ## Read-only guarantee
 *
 * Analysis and cross-check agents receive only the caller-supplied
 * `readOnlyTools` allowlist (read/search tools — no write/edit/shell). The
 * single write in the run is the report artifact, performed by the synthesis
 * agent, which is granted the read-only allowlist plus `Write`.
 *
 * ## Partial-failure posture
 *
 * The per-dimension fan-out is settled, not all-or-nothing (Story #4783). One
 * rejected dimension used to discard every sibling's completed work; the
 * engine now partitions the settled results, flows the fulfilled dimensions on
 * to the next phase, and records the rejected ones as an explicit
 * degraded-coverage note in the report's Executive Summary. This mirrors the
 * posture `close-validation/runner.js` already takes with per-gate errors:
 * capture the failure into the result rather than rejecting the whole run.
 * Only a *total* loss — every dimension rejected — throws, because there is
 * then nothing to synthesise.
 *
 * ## Report-contract self-check
 *
 * After synthesis the engine calls the caller-supplied `assertReportContract`
 * on the synthesis output and throws when the report is non-conformant, so a
 * lens can never silently emit a malformed report. The thrown message is
 * derived from the caller's `formatContractError` (when supplied) so each lens
 * can phrase the failure in its own terms.
 *
 * This module is dependency-free and lens-agnostic: it imports nothing from
 * any specific lens. It is exercised in isolation by
 * `tests/dynamic-workflow-audit-orchestrator.test.js` with a stub `agent` /
 * `phase` so the fan-out wiring is unit-testable without a live Claude Code
 * runtime.
 *
