/**
 * Degraded-coverage annotation for audit-lens reports (Story #4783).
 *
 * An audit lens fans out one sub-agent per analysis dimension. When one of
 * those dimensions rejects — a sub-agent that ran out of context, a
 * measurement command that failed, a transient runtime error — the run used to
 * discard every sibling dimension's completed work along with it.
 *
 * The engine now partitions instead: the fulfilled dimensions flow on to
 * synthesis, and the rejected ones are recorded here as an explicit note in
 * the report's Executive Summary. A lens that covers four of five dimensions
 * *and says which one is missing* is strictly more useful than one that yields
 * nothing — but only if the gap is visible. An unannotated partial report is
 * worse than no report, because it reads as complete coverage.
 *
 * The annotation is applied by the engine, not requested of the synthesis
 * agent: a coverage disclaimer that depends on an LLM remembering to write it
 * is not a disclaimer.
