 *
 * The two budgets are deliberately separate axes (Story #4543):
 *
 *   - `maxWaitSeconds` bounds **one invocation** of the merge wait. Its

 *     consume minutes of that. Expiry is NOT a block — the wait returns a

 *     with no such ceiling raises it to keep land-in-one-block semantics.
 *   - `maxBudgetSeconds` bounds the **cumulative** wait across resumes,
 *     anchored at the PR's `createdAt` so re-entering the wait does not
 *     restart the clock. Exhausting *this* is the genuine give-up condition
 *     that classifies and blocks.
 *
 * `updateAttempts` caps how many times the wait will bring a
 * behind-the-base PR up to date before giving the branch up as unwinnable,
 * rather than waiting out the budget behind a base it could have merged.
 * All keys default in the consumer when omitted (30s / 300s / 3600s / 3).
 *
 * `mode` selects the close-time merge posture (Story #4698). Default `sync`
 * keeps the in-close foreground wait unchanged. `async` caps the per-invocation
 * wait to a short probe window (~60s: catches instant merges and instantly-red
 * required checks) and then returns the resumable `pending` terminal, so a
 * slow-CI consumer no longer burns ~5 minutes of the host tool slot on a merge
 * that lands after the wait would have expired anyway — the worker launches the

 * `retroProposals` (Story #4418) governs the retro auto-filer: when true
 * (default) the retro's actionable routed proposals are filed as
 * `meta::<framework-gap|consumer-improvement>` + `friction::<category>`
 * issues via the graduator pre-parsed-findings seam, and the rendered retro
 * sections list the filed issue numbers instead of paste-ready `gh` command
 * stanzas; set it to `false` to fall back to the command stanzas.
 *
 * `frictionWindowDays` (Story #4850) bounds the run-scope friction recurrence
 * window by row age. The window deliberately spans every surviving signal
 * stream rather than the triggering run's own Stories — that is what lets a
 * once-per-Story systemic defect reach the ≥ 2 actionable threshold — which
 * left it unbounded in time, so a defect fixed weeks ago kept re-routing. An
 * integer ≥ 1; unset means 30 days.
