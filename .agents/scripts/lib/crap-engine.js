/**
 * Derive the raw per-method CRAP rows from an escomplex report.
 *
 * Single-sourced between `calculateCrapForSource` (CRAP-only path) and
 * `analyzeOnce` (combined MI + CRAP path) so the two cannot drift on how a
 * method's line is remapped or its coverage joined — the parity the
 * combined-parity suite asserts.
 *
 * **Coordinates (Story #4775, corrected by Story #4866).** `mapLine`
 * translates escomplex's `lineStart` — which is in *transpiled* coordinates
 * for a TS/TSX source — into the *original source* coordinates istanbul's
 * `fnMap` uses. A `null` mapper means the two coordinate systems already
 * coincide (plain JavaScript).
 *
 * #4775 let an unresolvable line fall back to the un-remapped value, which
 * made one scan emit rows in two coordinate systems with nothing on the row
 * saying which. Each row now records its own `coordinateSystem`, and an
 * un-remapped row joins no coverage at all: joining a transpiled line against
 * an original-source `fnMap` does not merely miss, it can land inside an
 * unrelated function's range and mis-attribute that function's coverage. An
 * honest `coverage: null` lets the scanner's `requireCoverage` policy decide,
 * exactly as it does for a genuinely uninstrumented method.
 *

/**
 * Apply the scanner's `requireCoverage` policy to raw method rows and report
 * how much of the coverage join actually landed.
 *
 * Two policies, one honest each way (Story #4775, fix part 3):
 *
 *   - `requireCoverage: true` — an unresolved method is skipped and counted,
 *     exactly as before. The baseline stays a record of measured code.
 *   - `requireCoverage: false` — an unresolved method scores as **0%
 *     covered** (`crap = c² + c`, the formula's own treatment of untested
 *     code) and lands in the baseline. Previously the flag only stopped
 *     whole *files* being skipped while each individual method was still
 *     dropped, which made it a no-op for baseline population — the caller
 *     asked for "score it anyway" and got silence.
 *
 * **Absent coverage is not zero coverage (Story #4871).** The 0%-covered
 * inference above is only defensible when a coverage **artifact** exists and
 * simply reports nothing for this method — "the tests ran and never reached
 * it" is a measurement. When no artifact was produced at all — a freshly
 * initialized story worktree, whose `coverage/` directory does not exist —
 * nothing was measured, and filling the gap with 0% manufactures a maximal
 * CRAP out of an absent observation, failing the first commit on files the
 * change never touched. `coverageAvailable: false` therefore makes such a
 * method **unscorable** under either policy: skipped and counted, never
 * filled. It is deliberately keyed on the artifact, not the per-file entry,
 * so `requireCoverage: false` keeps meaning "score untested code" whenever a
 * real coverage run stands behind the verdict.
 *
 * **Unjoinable is not untested (Story #4901).** Both policies above are about
 * a method whose coverage is *absent*; neither is about one whose coverage
 * could not be **joined**. A transpiled `startLine` is the latter — not in
 * the coordinate space the `fnMap` or the baseline is keyed against — so 0%
 * is not a measurement but a number invented for it, and `crapFormula(c, 0)`
 * is the maximal `c² + c`. Excluded under **either** policy, and counted.
 *
 * `resolvedMethods` / `totalMethods` count the *join*, not the fill, which is
 * what makes them a health signal for the updater's fail-closed
 * resolution-rate floor — so the exclusion is applied *after* both counters.
