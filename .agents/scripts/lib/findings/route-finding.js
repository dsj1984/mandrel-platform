/**
 * lib/findings/route-finding.js — Shared dedup/route helper for findings.
 *
 * This module is the single dedup/route implementation that both
 * `audit-to-stories` and `qa-explore` consume. It does three things:
 *
 *   1. `fingerprintFinding(finding)` — a stable sha1 over the finding's
 *      identity fields (`title`, `area`, `primaryFile`, `severity`,
 *      `labels`). Two runs over the same finding MUST produce the same
 *      sha, and unrelated prose drift MUST NOT change it.
 *   2. `fingerprintFooter(sha)` / `parseFingerprintFooter(body)` — round-trip
 *      the machine-readable `<!-- audit-fingerprints: sha,sha,... -->` marker
 *      stamped into Issue bodies.
 *   3. `routeFinding(finding, { searchIssues, searchCandidates })` — classify a
 *      finding against existing Issues into one of `new | update-existing |
 *      duplicate | regression-of-closed`. Routing gathers a candidate pool,
 *      then confirms identity against it. **Every wired port runs, and their
 *      results union** (Story #5079): the exact `searchIssues(sha)` lookup is
 *      what reliably retrieves an Issue by its footer sha, while the
 *      meaning-first `searchCandidates` pass (wired to
 *      `semantic-issue-search.js`) widens that pool to catch a reworded
 *      finding whose sha has drifted. The semantic pass **adds** to the
 *      fingerprint lookup; it never replaces it. Whichever ports are wired
 *      query BOTH open and closed issues; a closed fingerprint match yields
 *      `regression-of-closed`.
 *
 * Pure orchestration: no network I/O lives here. The `searchIssues` /
 * `searchCandidates` ports are injected by the caller (production wires them
 * to the GitHub provider; tests pass an in-memory stub).

 * - `searchIssues(sha)` is the **exact** lookup. A fingerprint sha is one

 * - `searchCandidates(finding)` is the **meaning-first** pass. It widens the
