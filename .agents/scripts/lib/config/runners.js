 * **Throughput tradeoff — `concurrencyCap`.**
 * The default of 3 is intentionally moderate: it keeps host-quota
 * consumption predictable for multi-Story plan-runs and avoids saturating
 * the GitHub API with concurrent label writes, while still allowing a
 * small ready-set fan-out. Operators who want strictly sequential delivery
 * should set `delivery.deliverRunner.concurrencyCap: 1`. Raising the cap
 * reduces wall-clock time where dependencies allow. See `mandrel-deliver.md` and
 * `agentrc-reference.json` `delivery.deliverRunner.concurrencyCap`.
 *
 * Story #4545 removed the sibling `verifyConcurrencyCap`: the
 * `verifyWaveResults` loop it claimed to bound never existed in the tree, and
 * its only reader was the retired execution-analysis CLI, which echoed the
 * number into a report rather than bounding anything.
 *
 * **Serialization tradeoff — `footprintGuard`.** `enforce` is the default and
 * stays it: the file-overlap guard encodes delivery-time-only knowledge (which
 * implementation windows are open, which Stories a foreign lease holds) that no
 * plan-time `depends_on` edge can carry, so demoting it by default would trade
 * a real merge-conflict class for throughput nobody asked for. `advisory`
 * detects collisions and reports every would-be withhold but lets dispatch
 * follow the declared edges alone — for runs whose ordering is fully declared
 * (Story #5044).
