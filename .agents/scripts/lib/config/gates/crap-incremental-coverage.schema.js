/* node:coverage ignore file -- AJV schema declaration (data-as-code) */

/**
 * `delivery.quality.gates.crap.incrementalCoverage` — the two independent
 * full-suite economies (Story #4981, split by Story #5173).
 *
 * Split into its own module (rather than an inline property literal on
 * `CRAP_GATE`) so the schema addition lands as a new file, not a same-file
 * expansion of `crap.schema.js` — the file this module's sole export is
 * spread into.
 *
 * The two switches are deliberately independent because they are not equally
 * safe:
 *
 *   - **`skipWhenUnchanged`** (default `true`) decides *whether* to capture:
 *     no changed file under `crap.targetDirs` versus `baseRef` means no
 *     capture at all. It is a pure saving — the gates score exactly what they
 *     scored before, because nothing they score moved.
 *   - **`baselineJoin`** (default `false`) loosens gate semantics: the CRAP
 *     join resolves a method in an untouched file from its committed baseline
 *     row instead of requiring fresh coverage for it.
 *
 * Bundling them under one `enabled` switch is what forced the earlier default
 * flip to be reverted. `enabled` survives as a deprecated alias that sets
 * both.
 *
 * Neither switch narrows the capture run itself: a capture that does happen is
 * the ordinary full `npm run test:coverage` (Story #5065).
