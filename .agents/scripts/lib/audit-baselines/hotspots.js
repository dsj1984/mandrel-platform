/**
 * hotspots.js — join per-gate outliers into ranked, per-file clusters
 * (Story #4902).
 *
 * The signal a baseline review is looking for is *convergence*: the file that
 * is simultaneously a CRAP outlier, a maintainability outlier, and a
 * duplication outlier is a different kind of problem from three unrelated
 * files each bad at one thing. Reading the baselines one at a time cannot see
 * it, because each gate's own top-20 is a different list.
 *
 * So severity **adds across gate memberships** and the three cost
 * multipliers apply to the sum. Two gate memberships of severity s therefore
 * outrank one membership of severity s at equal churn, centrality, and
 * friction — which is the ranking property this section exists to provide.
