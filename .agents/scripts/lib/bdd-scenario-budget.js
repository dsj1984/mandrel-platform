 * nearly the entire `PLAN_CONTEXT_ENVELOPE_BYTE_CEILING` headroom on its
 * own and blocking `/audit-to-stories`' single-plan path entirely.
 *
 * Deliberately a fixed framework constant rather than an `.agentrc.json`
 * knob: Story #4541 retired the one operator-tunable planner-context budget
 * (`planning.context.maxBytes`) because a cap the operator can raise past
 * what the model can read fails silently again, and the same reasoning
 * applies here.

 *
 * Deliberately module-private: the only production consumer is
 * {@link capBddScenarios} below via the `opts.byteBudget` default. Tests
 * assert the resulting behavior (truncation, order, fit) rather than
 * importing this value directly, so it carries no public export the
