 * change, not a representation one.

 * Nothing here is hand-mirrored any more: run `npm run docs:gen` after

 *
 * `loop.tick` was retired here on the same rule (Story #5024). Its only
 * producer was `emit-loop-tick.js`, which published to the lifecycle bus and
 * never called `notify()` at all — and the bus had no production caller, so
 * the event could not reach a webhook by any path. The notify CLI cannot
 * substitute: it hardcodes `event: 'operator-message'` and exposes no
 * `--event` flag, so a consumer could not dispatch it either. It shipped in
 * `NOTIFICATIONS_DEFAULTS`, which meant every consumer was subscribed by
 * default to something that could never fire.
 *
 * `story.heartbeat` was retired here first (A22): the vocabulary's contract is
 * "events the runtime actually emits", and nothing could emit this one. Its
 * emitter (`emit-story-heartbeat.js`) demanded an `epicId >= 1` while the
 * sole call path (`single-story-init.js` → `setActiveStoryEnv`) passed
 * `epicId: null`, so `CC_EPIC_ID` was never set and the hook that would have
 * fired the beat always short-circuited. Emitter, hook, and schema are all
 * deleted; keeping the name allowlistable would let an operator subscribe to
 * a channel that can never deliver. Removing it from the enum makes a
 * resurrection fail loudly at config-validation time rather than silently
 * never firing.

 * issue*, so only events that are about one Story, and whose message reads
 * as narrative an operator wants durably on the ticket, belong here. The
 * webhook-only remainder — `merge.unlanded` and `merge.flip-failed` — are
 * run-scoped beats; mirroring them onto the ticket would bury the narrative
 * under machine chatter, and `notify()` drops a comment for any dispatch
 * without a resolvable ticket id regardless.
 *
 * Note both webhook-only names are allowlistable but have no `notify()`
 * dispatcher today — they reach the run ledger via `appendLedgerEvent`, not
 * the notify path. That is a wiring gap, deliberately left alone by Story
 * #5024 (which only removed `loop.tick`, whose producer went with the bus):
 * unlike `loop.tick` these two have a live producer, so whether to wire the
 * dispatch or drop the allowlist entries is an open decision, not dead code.
 *
 * `story-closing` IS in scope by that rule (Story-scoped, `level: 'story'`,

 * absence was an oversight: the event was emittable to webhooks but could
 * not be allowlisted for comments at all. It is in the vocabulary but NOT

/**
 * The top-level `.agentrc.json` shape, post-reshape (Epic #1720 Story #1739).
 *
 * The four blocks mirror SDLC phases:
 *   - `project`  — identity, paths, commands, docs context.
 *   - `github`   — provider identity, branch protection, merge methods,
 *                  notifications.
 *   - `planning` — risk heuristics, max tickets, planning-context limits.
 *   - `delivery` — execution timeouts, worktree isolation, deliver-runner
 *                  concurrency, docs-freshness, signals, quality.
 *
 * Hard cutover (Epic #2646, Story #2687; finalized by Epic #2880, Story
 * #2935): the legacy `agentSettings.*` / `orchestration.*` input shape is
 * rejected entirely by this schema (top-level `additionalProperties: false`
 * fails any document carrying those keys), the corresponding resolver-side
 * compat branches were swept across the seven `lib/config/*.js` accessors,
 * and the output-side shim on `resolveConfig` was deleted — every consumer
 * now reads the canonical `project` / `github` / `planning` / `delivery`
 * blocks directly.
