/**
 * lib/audit-to-stories/build-story-body.js
 *
 * Render the canonical Story body for the standalone grouping mode so a
 * generated audit Story clears the same inline-contract bar the decomposer
 * enforces (`assertEveryStoryHasInlineContract`): a clean goal, observable
 * `acceptance[]`, a populated `changes[]` footprint, and a non-empty,
 * tier-tagged `verify[]` (Story #4270).
 *
 * Pure: returns { title, body, labels }. Labels carry one canonical
 * `audit::<lens>` per distinct source report represented in the merge
 * (derived from each finding's `sourceReport` basename, NEVER from the
 * fine-grained `dimension` text — see Story #4195), plus the standard
 * `type::story`, `agent::ready`, and (when any finding is Critical)
 * `risk::high`.
 *
 * The body is serialized via the canonical story-body serializer
 * (`.agents/scripts/lib/story-body/story-body.js`) so the output round-trips
 * through `parse()` / `serialize()`. Audit-specific content (agent prompts,
 * context links, fingerprint footer) is appended after the canonical sections
 * as extended markdown — it is informational only and is not part of the
 * structured contract.
