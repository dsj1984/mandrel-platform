/**
 * epic-grouping-directive.js — the container-Epic directive an audit sweep
 * emits (Story #5139).
 *
 * Lives on its own because **both** `/audit-to-stories` output paths carry it:
 * the `/mandrel-plan` seed one-pager (`seed-from-findings.js`) and the
 * standalone Story-draft transcript (`audit-to-stories.js`). A sweep is the
 * clearest case for a container — every Story shares a provenance and the
 * operator almost always wants them delivered together — so the Epic is the
 * **default** here, unlike the offer `/mandrel-plan` makes on an ad-hoc plan.
 *
 * It stays a directive in the text rather than an automatic write: the
 * workflow's Phase 4 HITL stop is where an operator declines it.
 *
 * Since Story #5155 the directive names adoption first: a repeat sweep over the
 * same area is the case most likely to already have a container, and opening a
 * second one beside it is the failure this ordering exists to prevent.
 *
