/**
 * runtime-friction.js — derive friction signals from observables the
 * runtime already has (Story #4578).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Friction telemetry was **opt-in**: a `friction` record existed only when
 * an agent volunteered a `diagnose-friction.js --story <id> --cmd <...>`
 * call. `plan-run-epilogue.js`'s `follow-up-rollup` then read an empty
 * `signals.ndjson` and truthfully reported "No friction signals — nothing
 * to follow up". A 7-Story run containing a mid-run git outage, a parked
 * worker needing an operator resume, and a four-round acceptance critic
 * produced a **zero-signal retro** — because the stream is least likely to
 * fill exactly when a run is going badly and the agent is busy.
 *
 * This module closes that gap from the other side: the runtime emits
 * friction from what it *already knows*, at the point it already knows it.
 * No agent cooperation required.
 *
 * ## Not a second channel
 *
 * These records go through the **existing** `appendSignal` path, carry the
 * **existing** `kind: 'friction'` shape, and land in the **same**
 * `signals.ndjson` stream `diagnose-friction.js` writes and the roll-up
 * reads. The only thing that is new is *who* decides to write.
 *
 * Deliberately distinct from {@link ../gates/friction.js}'s
 * `emitFrictionSignal`, which early-returns unless **both** `storyId` and
 * `epicId` are truthy. Every v2 Story is standalone (`epicId: null` — see
 * `temp-paths.storyTempDir`'s standalone branch), and the roll-up reads the
 * standalone stream via `forEachLine(null, sid, ...)`. Routing runtime
 * friction through the gate helper would drop **every** record on the floor,
 * silently, which is the bug this Story exists to fix.
 *
 * ## Robustness contract
 *
 * Observability MUST NOT halt the runner (`signals-writer.js`; the
 * `docs/patterns.md` friction pattern). Every export here is best-effort:
 * it swallows its own failures after a `Logger.warn` and resolves `false`.
 * A missing signal is strictly preferable to a broken close.
 *

 * The friction categories this module emits.

 * Values are plain strings by design: `signal-event.schema.json` types

 * change is required to add one. They are frozen here so the emitters and
 * their tests name the same literal instead of spreading it.
 *
 * Category choice is load-bearing for the retro: `retro-proposals.js`

/**
 * Emit the recovery counterpart of an earlier friction record in `category`
 * when a Story ultimately lands, netting a transient incident out of the
 * retro (generalized from the `close-failed`-only emitter of Story #4649 by
 * Story #4654).
 *
 * An incident that fires once — a transient block, a CI/lease/GitHub fault at
 * close, a merge wait that outran one window — but is provably resolved by the
 * time the Story lands still left an un-netted record on the stream, which the
 * composer counts exactly like an incident that never recovered. This appends
 * the companion record carrying the `recovered: true` discriminator in the
 * **same** `category` (a distinct bucket would itself aggregate into a routable
 * proposal, re-introducing the noise), so `netOutRecoveredIncidents` /
 * `deriveUnresolvedBlockedEvents` in `retro-proposals.js` can cancel the whole
 * `(category, storyId)` incident out.
 *
 * **Why this is not emitted from `frictionForTerminal`.** A `landed` terminal
 * envelope is emitted at the very END of close — *after* the post-land tail
 * has already gathered the signal stream and filed its follow-ups. A marker
 * written there would arrive too late to net anything out of the run that
 * produced it. So the emit hangs off `runPostLandTail`, which is the single
 * shared land point (reached from both the in-close land and the standalone
 * `single-story-confirm-merge.js` resume) and runs BEFORE follow-up capture.
 * The tail runs *because* the PR merged, so every incident on the stream is
 * provably resolved at that point.
 *
 * **Conditional on an actual incident.** The marker is appended only when the
 * Story's stream already carries an un-recovered record in `category`. Emitting
 * unconditionally on every land would write a category-mislabelled row for
 * Stories that never had the incident — and, because the netting is per
 * `(category, storyId)` over the cumulative stream, that spurious marker would
 * suppress the Story's whole bucket for `category`, making it un-routable at
 * story scope for a Story that never hit the incident at all.
 *
 * What this guard does NOT do is bound the netting once a *legitimate* marker
 * exists. The netting inherits the Story #4622 coarsening — per
 * `(category, storyId)` across the whole stream, not 1:1 pairing — so a
 * later, genuinely un-landed record in `category` for a Story that already
 * recovered once is still netted away, and does not even reach `discarded`.
 * Reaching that needs a re-close after a land (a confirm-merge resume, or a
 * close after a revert). Deliberate, inherited, and called out here rather
 * than papered over: an aggregate is a routing heuristic, not an incident
 * ledger.
 *
 * Best-effort; never throws. A read failure yields no marker (the incident
 * stays counted) rather than a speculative write.

 * Decide whether a `story-deliver-terminal` envelope is worth a friction

 * The partition is deliberate; each observable is emitted from exactly ONE
 * place, so one incident never double-counts into `occurrences: 2` and
 * fabricates a filed proposal out of a single event:
 *
 *   - `blocked`  → **null here.** Every blocked terminal flips the Story to
 *     `agent::blocked` (`confirm-merge.js`, both the `merge.unlanded` and
 *     `merge.flip-failed` paths), and that transition is instrumented at the
 *     canonical mutator (`ticketing/transition.js`). Emitting here as well
 *     would count the same block twice.
 *   - `landed`   → null. Nothing happened worth a retro.
 *   - `failed`   → friction. A close that ended non-zero.
 *   - `pending`  → friction **only when the cumulative wait budget is provably
 *     exhausted** (`waitBudget.cumulativeSeconds >= waitBudget.maxBudgetSeconds`).
 *     A `pending` return is reached at the per-invocation `maxWaitSeconds`
 *     bound (`phases/confirm-merge.js`); genuine cumulative exhaustion returns
 *     earlier as a **blocked** terminal via `blockOnUnlanded` (Story #4654).
 *     So a routine long-CI window rollover under budget is NOT exhaustion and
 *     emits nothing — its category name would otherwise assert an exhaustion
 *     that did not occur. Only the residual case the merge-wait guard cannot
 *     suppress — a merge that genuinely spends its whole budget and lands on a
 *     later resume — reaches here. A missing or non-numeric `cumulativeSeconds`
 *     / `maxBudgetSeconds` means exhaustion cannot be proven → emit nothing. A
 *     `pending` with **no** `waitBudget` is the `--no-wait-merge` /
 *     operator-merge path, where the human deliberately owns the land and
 *     nothing is broken — flagging it would train operators to ignore the
 *     channel.
 *
 * Deliberately **not exported**: it is this module's internal policy, and
 * `emitTerminalFriction` is the contract callers (and tests) exercise. An
 * export solely for testability would be production-dead code — the
 * `--production` dead-exports ratchet exists to catch exactly that.
