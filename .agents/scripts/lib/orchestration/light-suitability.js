/**
 * lib/orchestration/light-suitability.js — the `/deliver-light` suitability
 * gate and diff backstop (Story #4740).
 *
 * ## Why a light entry point exists
 *
 * mandrel-bench 2.12.0 forensics attributed the framework arm's cost to
 * **session multiplication** — repeated cold framework boots (2 for a one-file
 * greenfield build, 4 for a change request) — where the bare control does
 * comparable small work in a single session, lacking only the quality gates
 * and the landing guarantee. `/deliver-light` closes that gap: one session
 * straight to execution from an operator prompt, landing through the
 * **unchanged** `single-story-close.js` path. This module is the reusable
 * decision core the light workflow drives; it owns **no** git, branch, PR, or
 * label mutation — those stay in the shared engine scripts.
 *
 * ## Four invariants keep it proportional, not a planning bypass
 *
 *   1. **Suitability gate ({@link deriveLightSuitability}).** The prompt's
 *      predicted footprint is judged by the **shared shape machinery**
 *      ({@link module:lib/orchestration/complexity-gate.deriveStoryShape} over
 *      {@link module:lib/orchestration/complexity-gate.STORY_SHAPE_CEILINGS})
 *      **and** a ledgered model verdict carrying a recorded reason
 *      ({@link resolveLedgeredVerdict}). Both must agree on `lite`; either
 *      falling short fails closed to `full`. The shape axes are effort and
 *      risk — distinct change kinds, a coarse magnitude bucket, uncertainty,
 *      and epic-scope span — never artifact counts (Story #4764), so this gate
 *      is deliberately **coarse**: it rejects clearly-epic work, and invariant
 *      3 below does the real enforcement against ground truth.
 *   2. **Over-scope stops, never silently proceeds ({@link
 *      resolveLightGateOutcome}).** An over-ceiling prompt does **not**
 *      hard-fail — it STOPS and asks the operator to escalate to `/mandrel-plan` or
 *      proceed light. Both answers are executable: `proceed-light` is recorded
 *      through {@link resolveOperatorOverride}, which waives a *size
 *      prediction* only, never a risk rule, and only with a human present.
 *      Under `--yes` (unattended) it fails closed to recommending `/mandrel-plan`.
 *   3. **Diff-derived backstop ({@link checkLightDiffBackstop}).** After
 *      implementation the **actual** change set is re-checked with
 *      {@link module:lib/orchestration/review-depth.deriveChangeLevel} plus the
 *      implementation-only magnitude ceilings of {@link LIGHT_DIFF_CEILINGS} —
 *      the diff is the real scope signal — and an over-ceiling diff is blocked
 *      rather than landed silently. Story #4856 moved this from a `maxFiles: 4`
 *      cardinality ceiling to changed lines over implementation files, and made
 *      a block **recycle** its receipt Story through `/mandrel-plan` tickets mode
 *      instead of orphaning it.
 *   4. **Minimal receipt Story ({@link buildReceiptStoryTicket}).** A
 *      `type::story` ticket is authored inline so `refs #`, history, telemetry,
 *      and the `agent::executing -> agent::done` state machine survive.
 *
 * Every function here is pure and total: inputs in, decision out, no I/O and no
 * throws (except {@link buildReceiptStoryTicket}, which rejects an empty
 * prompt — a receipt with no prompt has nothing to record).
