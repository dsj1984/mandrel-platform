/**
 * epic-candidates.js — rank the open container Epics a new plan could join.
 *
 * Story #5155. `plan-persist` has always been able to *create* a container
 * Epic, and to re-adopt one whose fingerprint matches the exact cohort it is
 * re-persisting. Neither helps the case this module exists for: a second plan,
 * days later, adding work that belongs under the Epic a first plan opened. The
 * fingerprint is keyed on the child set, so a different cohort never matches
 * it — by design, since adopting the wrong container silently mis-files a run.
 *
 * So the join has to be a **decision**, not a hash collision: this module
 * surfaces every open Epic with an overlap score, and the operator picks at
 * Gate #3. The list is deliberately **complete rather than thresholded** — a
 * low score is evidence for the operator to weigh, and hiding a candidate is
 * how a plan silently opens its second container for one body of work.
 *
 * Scoring reuses `duplicate-search.js`'s tokenizer and Jaccard overlap rather
 * than growing a second similarity notion in the codebase; like that module's,
 * it is a triage signal and not a semantic search.
 *
 * @module lib/orchestration/epic-candidates
