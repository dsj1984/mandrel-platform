/**
 * run-plan-persist.js — flat Story persist for the v2 `/plan` collapse
 * (Stage 3 — `docs/roadmap.md`).
 *
 * Ordered, fail-closed pipeline:
 *
 *   1. Ticket validator + file-assumption + DAG + capacity + budget
 *   2. Draft reachability (named soft failure, exit 3)
 *   3. Split-policy partition (`assertAcceptancePartition`) + spec fold/spill
 *   4. Create Story issues (`type::story` + sanitized authored labels —
 *      deliberately NOT `agent::ready`), resumably via a plan fingerprint
 *   5. Upsert `story-plan-state` on every created Story; upsert `plan-summary`
 *      on the primary Story
 *   6. Flip every Story to `agent::ready` — the terminal step, so `ready`
 *      always implies "checkpoints written"
 *   7. Comment on + close the superseded `--tickets` source issues
 *      (Story #4535) — bookkeeping only; never fails the run
 *   8. Temp cleanup at terminal success + a stale-plan-dir reap
 *
 * **Why `agent::ready` moved to the end (Story #4541).** Issues used to be
 * born `agent::ready` in the creating POST while the checkpoints were
 * written afterwards. Anything picking a Story up in that window — or after
 * a comment failure aborted the loop — read the checkpoint as `null`
 * (`story-plan-state.js` degrades missing/malformed to `null`). Creating
 * unlabelled, writing checkpoints, then flipping closes that race.
 *
 * **No authored risk artifact (Story #4542).** Persist neither requires nor
 * accepts a risk verdict, derives no envelope from one, and computes no
 * review routing. Review depth and the acceptance-critic mode are derived from
 * the diff at close time (`review-depth.js#deriveChangeLevel`); `--force-review`
 * is an explicit operator flag, recorded here as a receipt and never inferred.
 *
 * Hard cutover: no Epic parent, no reconciler, no `deliveryShape`, no
 * `--amend` tree cascades. Those surfaces die with Stages 4–5 for any
 * remaining epic-delivery readers.

 * Resolve the plan's **effective** complexity route for persist
 * (Story #4722, superseding the envelope-verdict model of Story #4707).
 *
 * Two staged inputs, no word count anywhere:
 *
 *   1. **The planner's authored verdict** — `--route-downgrade-reason` is the
 *      lite claim's recorded reason (`resolvePlannerRouteVerdict`). No
 *      recorded reason means no claim: the plan persists as standard `full`
 *      and nothing is ledgered (`null`).

 *      `changes[]`, acceptance count, creates-vs-refactors mix, and
 *      sensitive-path classes). Any Story exceeding the ceilings **fails the
 *      claim closed to `full`** — the honest gate: after authoring, the work
 *      has measurable shape, so complexity is read from the work, not guessed
 *      from the seed.
 *
 * The resolved route decides whether the created Stories carry the
 * {@link LITE_ROUTE_LABEL} **hint** (never the control signal — `/deliver`
 * re-derives the route from the Story body's shape) and the `route` block
 * ledgered on their `story-plan-state` checkpoint, including the authored
 * verdict, its recorded reason, and the per-Story shape evidence. A refused
 * claim is ledgered too (route `full` with the refusal reasons), so the
 * judgment stays auditable either way.

 * (whose result reports the resolved route), so there is no test-only
 * export to leave production-dead.
