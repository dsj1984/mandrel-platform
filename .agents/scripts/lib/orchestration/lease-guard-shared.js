/**
 * lease-guard-shared.js — Story #3992: single-source the lease-acquisition
 * kernel shared by the three per-surface lease guards.
 *
 * The per-surface lease guards — today `single-story-lease-guard.js`;
 * historically also the retired Epic-tier deliver/plan guards —
 * each carried their own copy of
 * the operator-handle resolution and the fail-closed acquire wrapper around
 * `ticket-lease.acquireLease` (refuse any foreign assignee, throwing an
 * operator-facing message naming the current owner unless `--steal`). The
 * three copies had
 * already diverged — different `resolveOperator` signatures and different
 * missing-handle behaviour (`null` vs `throw`) — and were synchronised only
 * by docstring promise ("This mirrors the sibling lease guards…").
 *
 * This module is the single home for the kernel, modelled on the
 * shared plumbing inside `story-close/format-autofix.js` (Story #3332,
 * consolidated by Story #4017). The
 * per-surface guards now differ only in injected **policy**:
 *
 *   - **Operator candidates** — each surface supplies its own ordered
 *     candidate list (e.g. `--as` flag → `github.operatorHandle` →
 *     `git user.email` for `/deliver`; bare `operatorHandle` for the
 *     plan/standalone paths).
 *   - **Missing-handle behaviour** — `'null'` (return null; the caller fails
 *     closed at acquire time) vs `'throw'` (refuse immediately with surface
 *     wording). The divergence between the plan path (`null`) and the
 *     standalone path (`throw`) is intentional: the plan path also calls
 *     `resolveOperator` on its best-effort release leg, where a missing
 *     handle must degrade to a `no-operator` no-op rather than throw.
 *   - **Refusal wording** — each surface renders its own operator-facing
 *     message via `renderRefusal(result, ticketId)`.
 *
 * A third axis, **liveness anchoring**, is gone: Story #5006 deleted the
 * lease TTL, so every foreign claim refuses unconditionally and there is no
 * heartbeat to anchor.
 *
 * The unclaimed / already-held / foreign-claim decision table itself (and
 * the steal transfer) lives in `ticket-lease.acquireLease`; this kernel owns
 * the refuse-by-throw boundary that the three guards previously each
 * re-implemented.
 *
 * Per `.agents/rules/orchestration-error-handling.md`, failures surface via
 * `throw new Error(...)`, never `Logger.fatal`.

/**
 * Resolve the operator handle from an ordered candidate list, applying the
 * surface's missing-handle policy.
 *
 * Each candidate is passed through the shared `normalizeOperatorHandle` so a
 * leading `@` is stripped (the assignees API expects bare logins, not
 * `@`-prefixed mentions) and the shipped `@[USERNAME]` placeholder maps to
 * `null` — otherwise the assignee PATCH is rejected (HTTP 422) and the
 * self-held-claim comparison (`owner === operator`) never matches. The first
 * candidate that normalises to a non-null handle wins.
 *
 * @param {object} opts
 * @param {Array<string|null|undefined>} opts.candidates  Ordered raw handles.
 * @param {'null'|'throw'} [opts.missingHandleBehavior='null']  What to do
 *   when no candidate resolves: return `null`, or throw with the surface's
 *   configured wording.
 * @param {string} [opts.missingHandleMessage]  Error message used when
 *   `missingHandleBehavior` is `'throw'`.
 * @returns {string|null} Bare operator handle, or `null` (policy `'null'`).
 * @throws {Error} When no candidate resolves and the policy is `'throw'`.
