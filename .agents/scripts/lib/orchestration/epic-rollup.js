/**
 * epic-rollup.js — derive a container Epic's board state from its children.
 *
 * A container Epic is never delivered, so nothing in the delivery engine
 * ever writes to it. That left it inert on the board for the whole run it
 * was the subject of: `columnForLabels` reads `agent::*` labels and the
 * container carries none by construction, so the Status sync always skipped
 * it; and the only closure lived in the multi-Story run epilogue, which a
 * single-Story delivery never reaches.
 *
 * This module is the one place that answers "what state is this Epic in?"
 * — by asking its children — and the one place that writes the answer.
 * {@link rollUpEpicForStory} is invoked from the two per-Story lifecycle
 * edges (the `agent::executing` flip in `single-story-init.js` and the
 * post-land tail), which is what makes the rollup hold at N=1, and the run
 * epilogue delegates its Epic close here so one closure rule exists.
 *
 * Three invariants shape the writes:
 *
 *   1. **The Epic never gains an `agent::*` label.** That absence keeps the
 *      container out of the bare `/mandrel-deliver` ready list and outside
 *      `lint-issue-body.js`, so the derived column goes to the board
 *      directly via `ColumnSync.setColumn` rather than through a label.
 *   2. **Status recomputes in both directions; closure is one-way.** A
 *      reopened child pulls a closed Epic's Status back to `In Progress`
 *      and MUST NOT reopen the issue — an operator who closed a container
 *      deliberately is not overruled by a reopened child.
 *   3. **Never throws.** Every step degrades with a reason. A stale
 *      container costs tidiness; a delivery failed on a board mutation
 *      costs a landed Story its terminal envelope.
 *   4. **Closure requires an authoritative child list.** Invariant 3 makes
 *      every read degrade rather than fail, which is right for the writes
 *      that recompute next tick and wrong for the one that does not. When
 *      the native sub-issue read fails, the body checklist still answers
 *      "who are the children" — but no longer "are these *all* of them",
 *      and closing on that difference shut an Epic over 23 open children
 *      (Story #5210). Degraded reads keep the Status and assignee writes
 *      and lose only the close.
 *
 * @module lib/orchestration/epic-rollup
 * @see Story #5205
 * @see Story #5210 — fail closed on a degraded child read.
