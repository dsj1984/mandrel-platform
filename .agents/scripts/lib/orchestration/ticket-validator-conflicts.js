 * `collectStoryAssumptionEntries` (Story #3302) and the sizing gate's
 * `resolveStoryBody` (Story #4271).
 *
 * The decomposer emits `body` as the canonical serialized **string**, but
 * the conflict passes (`indexConsumers`, `indexAssumptionEntries`,
 * `computeMissingBddScaffoldFindings`, and the producer path scan in
 * `collectStoryProducerPaths`) historically read `story.body` only when it
 * was already an object — so on the production string shape the
 * `implicit-cross-story-dep`, `fan-out`, registry, and `missing-bdd-scaffold`
 * findings emitted nothing. Parsing the body once at the entry point and
 * threading the normalized Story through every pass restores parity.
 *
 * `collectStoryAssumptionEntries` already parses string bodies itself, so a
 * normalized object body round-trips through it unchanged. The returned Story
 * keeps every other field (notably `slug` and `depends_on`) intact.
 *
 *   - **string body** → parsed via `parseStoryBody`; an unparseable string
 *     yields `body: null` (the passes degrade to "no structured signal",
 *     never throw mid-validation).
 *   - **object body** → returned verbatim.
 *   - **null / other** → `body: null`.
 *
 * @param {object} story
 * @returns {object} A shallow clone of `story` with a structured `body`.

/**
 * Cross-Story path-conflict & implicit-dependency findings.
 *
 * Two related gaps in the original decomposition validator motivate this
 * module:
 *
 *   1. The legacy freshness gate only audits paths under
 *      `.agents/scripts | lib | tests` and operates on individual Tasks. A
 *      decomposition that produces multiple Wave-0 Stories each editing the
 *      same shared file (e.g. `.github/workflows/quality.yml`) sails through
 *      validation, but parallel dispatch produces merge conflicts on every
 *      Story-to-Epic close after the first.
 *
 *   2. The validator's `depends_on` graph only honors explicit slug links.
 *      A Story whose Task `verify` block reads a file produced by a Task in
 *      a different Story has no dependency expressed, even though the
 *      consumer Story would fail execution-time verification when run in
 *      the same wave as the producer.
 *
 * Both gaps share a single underlying mechanism — a path-keyed graph across
 * all Tasks in the spec — which is why detection lives in one module.
 *
 * The module is pure: it consumes the already-normalized ticket array (with
 * lifted Task→Story `depends_on` deps applied) and returns a structured
 * findings array. Severity is `'soft'` by default; the caller's policy
 * flags upgrade findings to `'hard'`, which routes them through
 * `renderHardConflictError` and into the validator's `errors[]` channel.
