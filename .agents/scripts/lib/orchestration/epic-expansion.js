/**
 * Expand any container-Epic id in the requested set to its open child

 * expansion happens **here, before resolution**, so everything downstream —
 * the DAG, the ready set, the wave tick, the close tail — sees an ordinary
 * list of Story ids and needs no Epic concept at all. That is the whole
 * reason the Epic can exist without touching the delivery engine.
 *
 * Expansion is **per id**, so Epic and Story ids may be mixed freely in one
 * invocation and the result is the deduped union in first-seen order.
 *
 * Two filters apply to children, and they are deliberately quieter than the
 * treatment of a *named* id:
 *
 *   - **A closed / `agent::done` child is dropped.** Delivering an Epic means
 *     delivering what is left of it. A dependent's edge onto a landed sibling
 *     still resolves: the sibling becomes a *foreign* blocker, and foreign
 *     blockers are checked against live state and enter `done[]`.
 *   - **A child that is not a `type::story` is dropped with a warning.** A
 *     named non-Story is an error because the operator asserted it was
 *     deliverable; a linked one is the Epic's assertion, and someone attaching
 *     a stray issue in the GitHub UI must not wedge the whole run.
 *
 * An Epic that expands to nothing is an **error**, not an empty success: a
 * silent empty envelope would report a clean no-op for a delivery the
 * operator asked for and never got.
