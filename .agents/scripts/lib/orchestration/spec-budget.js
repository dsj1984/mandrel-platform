 *   aim: interfaces, invariants, and load-bearing constraints, not
 *   route-by-route behavior narration. It lives in the story-author template
 *   placeholder (`plan-context.js`), which is what an author actually reads.
 * - **350 words — this warn threshold.** Deliberately slack against the
 *   target so the warning marks a real outlier rather than ordinary
 *   authoring variance. Measured over the 45 most recent Stories carrying a
 *   Spec, a 250-word threshold fired on 22% of *accepted* work (median 233,
 *   p75 249) — a warning that common trains its readers to ignore it.
 *
 * Distinct again from the hard ~1500-token fail-closed ceiling in
 * `spec-spill.js`: this budget only warns; it never fails the persist.
