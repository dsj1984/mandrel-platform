/**
 * lib/orchestration/complexity-gate.js — shape-derived complexity routing
 * (Story #4722, superseding the word-count gate of Stories #4683/#4707).
 *
 * ## Route on the work, not the words
 *
 * The original gate routed a planning seed on its **word count**
 * (`maxSeedWords`), which is the wrong proxy in both directions: a detailed
 * prompt can describe trivial work, a terse one complex work. The bench
 * cohort (mandrel-bench 2.10.0) observed both failure modes — a lite verdict
 * fired at plan time and was then lost (a swallowed label write) or ignored
 * (deliver spawned a full story-worker anyway). This module now routes on the
 * **objective shape of the authored work**, staged across the pipeline:
 *
 *   1. **Plan time — signals, not routing.** {@link buildComplexitySignals}
 *      emits advisory complexity *signals* (enumerated-artifact count,
 *      risk-heuristic hits, repo state of predicted paths, sensitive-path
 *      classes) carrying **no routing authority**. There is no word ceiling.
 *   2. **Planner judgment, ledgered.** The planner owns the
 *      trivial-vs-standard verdict ({@link resolvePlannerRouteVerdict}) —
 *      `lite` only with a recorded reason, persisted on plan state. This
 *      generalizes the former one-way `applyPlannerDowngrade` seam into the
 *      authored verdict itself; the conservative default without a recorded
 *      reason is `full`.
 *   3. **Deterministic backstop at persist.** After authoring, the work has
 *      measurable shape: {@link deriveStoryShape} reads the Story's own
 *      effort and risk — distinct change kinds, declared magnitude,
 *      uncertainty, deployable/migration span, and sensitive-path classes —
 *      against {@link STORY_SHAPE_CEILINGS}. A `lite` claim whose work exceeds
 *      them **fails closed to `full`** (`run-plan-persist.js`). Artifact
 *      cardinality is deliberately not an axis (Story #4764).
 *   4. **Deliver dispatches on topology alone.** The dispatch *mode*
 *      ({@link resolveStoryDispatchMode}) answers a different question from
 *      the route: may the engine run in the router's own session? Only a
 *      **single-Story run** may (Story #4736) — sub-agent isolation buys
 *      nothing when there is no concurrent sibling to isolate from. Shape
 *      cannot grant that session (Story #4829): a lite body makes work cheap,
 *      it does not conjure a second session for a sibling to run in. Story
 *      #5006 removed the shape derivation that survived there for reporting,
 *      since no consumer read it. The `route::lite` label is a
 *      **human-visible hint only**, never the control signal. Either way every
 *      `single-story-close.js` gate runs unchanged.
 *
 * The shape taxonomy is deliberately the one `review-depth.js` already
 * applies to the landed diff at close (`deriveChangeLevel` over the
 * `audit-rules.json` sensitive-path classes): **predicted shape at dispatch,
 * actual diff at close** — one taxonomy, two read points. And sensitivity
 * always wins: a small change whose footprint intersects a sensitive-path
 * class routes `full`, which keeps its fresh acceptance critic
 * (`ceremony-routing.js` routes a high derived level to a fresh spawn).
 *
 * ## What "lite" changes and — critically — what it never changes
 *
 * The lite route collapses the **advisory ceremony** only: the story-worker
 * sub-agent boot and the fresh acceptance-critic spawn. It **never** relaxes
 * a non-negotiable. {@link LITE_PATH_INVARIANTS} is the machine-readable
 * contract that the lite path still produces a Story ticket, still lands via
 * a PR to `main`, still runs every repo quality gate, and still honours
 * `rules/security-baseline.md`. Those gates run in `single-story-close.js`
 * regardless of route; the router cannot and does not switch them off.
 *
 * ## Configuration
 *
 * Operators tune the surface via `planning.complexityGate` in `.agentrc.json`:
 *
 *   - `enabled`      (default `true`) — `false` disables lite routing
 *     everywhere: persist refuses lite claims and dispatch always takes the
 *     sub-agent path.
 *   - `maxArtifacts` (default `1`)    — enumerated-artifact signal threshold;
 *     an **input signal** for the planner, no longer a deterministic router.
 *
 * `maxSeedWords` is **removed** (hard cutover): word count routes nothing.
 *

/**
 * Effort/risk ceilings a Story's work must fit for the `lite` route
 * ({@link deriveStoryShape}). Framework constants, not operator knobs — a
 * ceiling an operator can widen past what the inline path can safely absorb is
 * a ceiling that fails silently.
 *
 * ## Effort and risk, never artifact cardinality (Story #4764)
 *
 * These ceilings used to count the declared footprint (`maxChanges: 2`,
 * `maxAcceptance: 3`, `maxNonCreateChanges: 1`). Cardinality is the wrong axis
 * in both directions: three identical one-line edits across three files is
 * trivial work with a high count, while a 200-line rewrite of one module is a
 * single change. And the count was read off a footprint the model **declares
 * before doing the work** — a guess, and a gameable one — so counting it
 * rejected genuinely small work (mandrel-bench's hello-world scenario is a
 * server create plus a `package.json` edit plus a test create, structurally
 * over the old ceilings) while admitting whatever an optimistic declaration
 * under-counted.
 *
 * So the axes are effort, risk, and uncertainty, and the **prediction** gate
 * they form is deliberately **coarse**: it rejects clearly-epic work only.
 * Real enforcement belongs to the diff-derived backstop, which sees ground
 * truth instead of a declaration
 * ({@link module:lib/orchestration/light-suitability.checkLightDiffBackstop}).
 *
 *   - `maxChangeKinds` — distinct change KINDS, not files. N instances of one
 *                        mechanical edit is one kind at N sites; enumerating
 *                        more kinds than this is a multi-capability scope.
 *   - `maxMagnitude`   — coarse magnitude bucket, declared alongside the
 *                        footprint: `trivial` < `moderate` < `substantial`.
 *   - `maxUncertainty` — is the shape determined by the request
 *                        (`determined`), or does it still need the design
 *                        decisions `/mandrel-plan` exists to resolve
 *                        (`needs-design`)?
 *   - `maxDeployables` — named deployable roots (`apps/<x>`, `packages/<x>`, …)
 *                        the footprint spans; more than one is epic by
 *                        construction.
 *
 * Two rules ride beside the ceilings and are not tunable at all: a footprint
 * pairing a migration with its consumers is epic scope, and a footprint
 * intersecting a sensitive-path class routes `full` however small or mechanical
 * it is — the hard gate, unchanged.
 *

/**
 * Derive the complexity route from an authored Story's **effort and risk**
 * (Story #4722 AC-3/AC-4; re-anchored off artifact cardinality by Story #4764)
 * — the single shape function persist's backstop and `/mandrel-deliver`'s dispatch
 * derivation both read, so the two can never disagree about the same body.
 *
 * `lite` requires **every** signal to agree, against
 * {@link STORY_SHAPE_CEILINGS}:
 *
 *   - a declared, parseable, glob-free `changes[]` footprint — width is not
 *     counted, but an unknown width cannot be judged;
 *   - at least one acceptance criterion (a Story with no contract cannot be
 *     judged trivial). The criteria are **not** capped: criterion count is
 *     contract detail, not effort;
 *   - at most `maxChangeKinds` distinct change kinds, magnitude no worse than
 *     `maxMagnitude`, uncertainty no worse than `maxUncertainty`, and at most
 *     `maxDeployables` deployable roots — plus no migration-with-consumers
 *     span. These are the clearly-epic rejections, and nothing finer: the
 *     declared footprint is a guess, so the diff-derived backstop does the real
 *     enforcement (see {@link STORY_SHAPE_CEILINGS});
 *   - a footprint intersecting **no** sensitive-path class
 *     (`deriveChangeLevel`, the taxonomy close applies to the landed diff).
 *     Sensitivity always wins (AC-6): a sensitive footprint routes `full`
 *     however small or mechanical, which keeps the fresh acceptance critic via
 *     `ceremony-routing.js`.
 *
 * Everything else — an unknown/undeclared footprint, a malformed magnitude or
 * uncertainty claim, or an unreadable sensitive-path manifest — fails toward
 * `full`. Total: never throws.

/**
 * Decide how `/mandrel-deliver` executes a Story: **run topology, and nothing else.**
 *
 * **`inline` names one indivisible resource: the router's own session.** Two
 * Stories cannot both own it, so exactly one premise can grant it —
 * **run topology (Story #4736)**: a run resolving a *single* Story executes
 * inline whatever its shape, because sub-agent isolation is load-bearing only
 * for CONCURRENT dispatch (two workers sharing a checkout race on worktrees and
 * branch refs) and a one-Story run has no sibling to race. It therefore pays
 * the spawn premium (a boot is a cache WRITE at full rate, where an inline
 * continuation is a cache read at ~10%; ~$1.43/M vs ~$1.07/M on comparable
 * bench work) for nothing.
 *
 * **Shape cannot grant it (Story #4829).** The shape read used to return
 * `inline` for any lite-shaped body in a multi-Story run, inheriting no
 * topology guard. Measured twice on 2026-07-29: a two-Story and a three-Story
 * run came back `inline` for *every* Story while `stories-wave-tick.js`
 * reported the whole set ready under a concurrency cap of five — a router
 * following both signals literally runs several engines over one session and
 * one checkout, the precise hazard the sub-agent path exists to prevent.
 *
 * **So this function reads only `storyCount` (Story #5006).** #4829 left the
 * body parse, the shape derivation, the `route::lite` hint note and the
 * `planning.complexityGate.enabled` branch in place to populate a `route`
 * field for reporting — but the sole consumer, `resolve-stories.js`, reads
 * `.mode` and discards the rest, so every one of those inputs was a parse
 * whose result nothing could act on. A caller that wants the shape calls
 * {@link deriveStoryShape} directly, as the light path and plan-persist do.
 *
 * Inline execution removes model-side fan-out only — it changes **where** the
 * engine runs, never **what** runs. Every deterministic
 * `single-story-close.js` gate, the PR to `main`, and the
 * `story-deliver-terminal` envelope are identical in both modes; see the
 * module header's non-negotiables.
 *
 * @param {{ storyCount?: unknown }} [args] `storyCount` is the number of
 *   Stories the invoking `/mandrel-deliver` run resolved. Omitted (or not exactly 1)
 *   means the run cannot be shown sibling-free and therefore dispatches as a
 *   sub-agent — never an assumed 1.
 * @returns {{ mode: 'inline'|'subagent', reasons: string[] }}
