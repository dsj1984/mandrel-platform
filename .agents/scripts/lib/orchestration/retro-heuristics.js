/**
 * Heuristics that drive which retro path the `epic-retro` helper composes.
 *
 * The compact three-section retro fires when the Epic's dispatch manifest
 * carries zero friction signals. Non-zero on any of the five dimensions
 * routes back to the full six-section retro. Keeping the predicate here
 * (pure, no I/O) guards the clean-sprint definition from drifting as the
 * retro helper markdown evolves.
 *
 * Epic #1030 Story #1046 — the `friction` count is now sourced from the
 * aggregated `story-perf-summary.frictionByCategory` totals across the
 * Epic's descendants (the unified summary comment posted by
 * `analyze-execution.js`), not the legacy per-Task `friction` structured
 * comment fan-out. The predicate signature stays unchanged — the input
 * is still a single integer count — so callers only need to swap their
 * data source.
 *
 * Story #2289 — added `interventions`, sourced from the
 * `manualInterventions` array on the `epic-run-state` snapshot read
 * via `epic-run-state-store.read`. The same list disqualifies the
 * Epic from auto-merge, so the retro shape and the auto-merge gate
 * now agree on what "clean" means.

/**
 * Evaluate whether an Epic's dispatch manifest counts qualify for the
 * compact retro path.
 *
 * All five signals must be zero. Any non-zero value (including negatives,
 * which are invalid but treated defensively as "non-clean") returns false.
 * Non-number inputs are treated as missing and default to zero so callers
 * can omit dimensions they have not yet gathered — a call with no arguments
 * returns true.
 *
 * @param {Object} [counts]
 * @param {number} [counts.friction=0]      Aggregate friction-event count, summed from `story-perf-summary.frictionByCategory` across the Epic's descendants (Story #1046).
 * @param {number} [counts.parked=0]        Count of parked follow-on Stories (no manifest lineage).
 * @param {number} [counts.recuts=0]        Count of Stories carrying a `<!-- recut-of: #N -->` marker.
 * @param {number} [counts.hitl=0]          Count of tickets that raised an `agent::blocked` event mid-sprint (the runtime HITL pause point).
 * @param {number} [counts.interventions=0] Count of recorded manual interventions (the same `manualInterventions` list the auto-merge predicate consults — Story #2289).
 * @returns {boolean}
