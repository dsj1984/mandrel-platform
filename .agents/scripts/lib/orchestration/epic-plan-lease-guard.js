/**
 * epic-plan-lease-guard.js — `/plan` workflow guards (Story #3481,
 * Epic #3457).
 *
 * Wires the assignee-as-lease primitive (`ticket-lease.js`, Story #3480) and a
 * decompose-idempotency guard into the split planning flow so two concurrent
 * `/plan` runs cannot both drive the same Epic, and so a re-run does not
 * silently duplicate the Feature/Story tree:
 *
 *   - `acquireEpicPlanLease`   — claim the Epic before Phase 7 (spec). Refuses
 *                                (throws, exit non-zero) when a live foreign
 *                                claim already holds the Epic, naming the
 *                                current owner. **Claim-time liveness
 *                                (Story #4019):** `/plan` emits no
 *                                `story.heartbeat`, so the lease records its
 *                                own claim-time in a `plan-lease` structured
 *                                comment on the Epic at acquire time. A
 *                                foreign claim fresher than the lease TTL
 *                                refuses (unless `--steal`); a stale or
 *                                record-less claim is reclaimed
 *                                automatically. An unassigned or self-held
 *                                Epic still proceeds.
 *   - `releaseEpicPlanLease`   — release the claim after Phase 8 (decompose).
 *                                Best-effort and self-scoped: a no-op once the
 *                                Epic was reassigned elsewhere.
 *   - `assertNoOpenPlanChildren` — refuse Phase 8 persist when the Epic already
 *                                has open Story children, unless the
 *                                operator passed `--force` (a deliberate
 *                                re-decompose that closes the old tree).
 *
 * The spec-persist idempotency already lives in `phases/plan-epic.js`
 * (keyed on the Epic body's managed planning sections); these guards add
 * the cross-run mutual exclusion and the child-duplication refusal
 * around it.

 * (`acquireEpicPlanLease`) then fails closed by throwing rather than running an
 * ownerless, unguarded plan.

 *     treated as stale and reclaimed — the assignee predates this
