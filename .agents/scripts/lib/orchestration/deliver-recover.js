/**
 * deliver-recover.js — probe a stranded Story and name its ONE next command
 * (Story #4543).
 *
 * Recovery here is a **read, not a repair**. Every input is already
 * probeable — labels and lease from the ticket, the branch locally and via
 * its tracking ref, the worktree path, the PR by head branch (with state,
 * merge, and checks probes) — so this module is probes, a decision table
 * over `label × PR × branch × worktree`, and one command with the evidence it
 * was derived from. It never mutates anything, and it never prints a menu of
 * options: a menu is what an operator already has, and it is the thing they
 * cannot act on.
 *
 * The strand shapes the table resolves, and why each is real:
 *
 *   - `executing` with no PR → resume implementation. The work never reached
 *     close.
 *   - `closing` with a pending PR → resume the land. The overwhelmingly
 *     common shape now that the merge wait is bounded: the wait returned
 *     `pending` and something has to pick it back up.
 *   - `closing` with a red PR → enter the fix loop. Waiting is pointless; no
 *     budget turns a failed check green.
 *   - `closing` with a MERGED PR → run confirm. **This is the strand a
 *     `/deliver` re-run refuses outright**, because `single-story-init.js`
 *     hard-errors on an already-closed Story — so before this surface, the
 *     merged-but-label-stale Story had no automated way back.
 *   - `done` with a drifted board → run resync. The GitHub Projects bot won
 *     the race.
 *   - `blocked` → print the class-specific remediation the friction comment
 *     already names, rather than inventing a second opinion about a
 *     condition that was already classified.
 *
 * The command vocabulary is shared with the terminal envelope
 * (`story-deliver-terminal.js#NEXT_COMMANDS`), so recovery and normal
 * resumption speak one language instead of two dialects for one state.
