/**
 * dependency-candidates.js — open Stories a newly planned Story may need to
 * wait for.
 *
 * Story #5155. `depends_on[]` has always ordered *siblings within one plan*.
 * Nothing surfaced the other ordering that actually bites: a Story authored
 * today that edits a file an already-open Story from an earlier plan is going
 * to rewrite. Delivered concurrently, the second lands on a base the first
 * just changed — and the planner had no way to see it coming, because the
 * duplicate search asks "is this the same Story?" (title/body similarity),
 * never "does this Story touch what I am about to touch?".
 *
 * Overlap here is therefore computed on **declared footprints**, not prose:
 * the seed's `predictedPaths` against each open Story's parsed `changes[]`,
 * via the same `storyFootprint` the wave runner uses to withhold colliding
 * Stories at dispatch. That is deliberate — the planner sees the collision the
 * runtime would later enforce, one layer earlier and while it is still cheap
 * to order around.
 *
 * The result is **advisory**: an overlap is a prompt to consider an edge, not
 * proof one is needed. Two Stories can touch a shared barrel file with no real
 * ordering between them; only the operator knows.
 *
 * @module lib/orchestration/dependency-candidates
