/**
 * epic-container.js — the one module describing a container Epic.
 *
 * An Epic here is a **pure container**: a `type::epic` issue whose body is a
 * short `## Goal` paragraph and a `- [ ] #N` child checklist, and nothing
 * else. It carries no `## Spec`, no `acceptance[]` / `verify[]`, and no
 * `agent::*` label. It is never branched, never implemented and never
 * delivered — `/mandrel-deliver <epicId>` expands it to its open children and
 * delivers those.
 *
 * **Linkage is parent→child only.** The Epic holds every edge; Story bodies
 * are never touched. That is the whole reason this can exist without
 * reversing ADR `20260726-v2-story-collapse`: the `Epic: #N` footer stays
 * retired and every refusal that reads it still fires, so each Story remains
 * independently deliverable and the delivery engine stays Story-only.
 *
 * Both consumers — `plan-persist` (which writes an Epic) and
 * `resolve-stories` (which expands one) — import from here so the written
 * shape and the read shape cannot drift apart.
 *
 * **The container's lifecycle is derived, never labelled.** It still carries
 * no `agent::*` label — that absence is what keeps it out of the bare
 * `/mandrel-deliver` ready list and outside `lint-issue-body.js`. What it does
 * carry is a Projects v2 Status column, an owner while its children run, and
 * eventually a closed state, all computed from the children by
 * `epic-rollup.js` and written directly (Story #5205). Deriving rather than
 * labelling is the whole reason those two facts can coexist.
 *
 * @module lib/orchestration/epic-container
 * @see Story #5139

/**
 * The checklist grammar: a checklist row, and the **first** issue reference
 * anywhere on it. The checklist is a durable mirror of the native sub-issue
 * edges rather than a second, competing representation — when the sub-issues
 * API is unavailable (an older GHES, a revoked scope, a rate-limit burst) the
 * children are still discoverable from the body alone.
 *
 * Deliberately the **loosest** of the three grammars that read this shape, and
 * looser than it was: it used to require the id to be the whole row
 * (`- [ ] #123`), which matched none of the annotated rows a hand-maintained
 * rollout tracker actually carries — `- [ ] Design sign-off (#1897): pending`,
 * `- [ ] 1.4 #1909 (Part B blocked)`. An Epic with 58 children presented three
 * to the rollup, which closed it with 23 still open (Story #5210).
 *
 * It is NOT in sync with `_getChecklistChildren` (`providers/github/issues.js`)
 * and no longer claims to be: that one is a general parent→child strategy for
 * any issue and still requires `#N` immediately after the checkbox. Reading a
 * superset here is safe in the direction that matters — a spurious id costs a
 * skipped non-Story child, while a missed id costs a container closed over open
 * work. The union with the native edges keeps both honest, and after #5210
 * nothing irreversible is decided on this grammar alone.
