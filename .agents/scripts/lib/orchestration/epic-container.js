/**
 * epic-container.js — the one module describing a container Epic.
 *
 * An Epic here is a **pure container**: a `type::epic` issue whose body is a
 * short `## Goal` paragraph and a `- [ ] #N` child checklist, and nothing
 * else. It carries no `## Spec`, no `acceptance[]` / `verify[]`, and no
 * `agent::*` label. It is never branched, never implemented and never
 * delivered — `/mandrel-deliver <epicId>` expands it to its open children and
 * delivers those.
 *
 * **Linkage is parent→child only.** The Epic holds every edge; Story bodies
 * are never touched. That is the whole reason this can exist without
 * reversing ADR `20260726-v2-story-collapse`: the `Epic: #N` footer stays
 * retired and every refusal that reads it still fires, so each Story remains
 * independently deliverable and the delivery engine stays Story-only.
 *
 * Both consumers — `plan-persist` (which writes an Epic) and
 * `resolve-stories` (which expands one) — import from here so the written
 * shape and the read shape cannot drift apart.
 *
 * @module lib/orchestration/epic-container
 * @see Story #5139
