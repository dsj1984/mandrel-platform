/**
 * Story sizing model — a small flat set of knobs plus the optional `wide`
 * declaration that lifts the hard file-width rejection. Co-located with
 * `ticket-validator.js`, but kept as its own module so the validator's
 * primary file stays under the maintainability ceiling. The validator
 * imports `computeSizingFindings` and `renderHardFindingError` and stitches
 * the result onto its return value as `findings` / `errors`.
 *
 * `DEFAULT_TASK_SIZING` is the **single source of truth** for the sizing
 * thresholds. The decomposer prompt template
 * (`.agents/scripts/lib/templates/decomposer-prompts.js`) and the authoring
 * SKILL (`.agents/skills/core/epic-plan-decompose-author/SKILL.md`) reference
 * these numbers rather than restating divergent ones — the prompt generates
 * its threshold sentence from this constant so the two surfaces cannot drift.
 * Keep it in lockstep with `.agents/schemas/agentrc.schema.json`
 * (`$defs.taskSizing`) and the JS mirror in
 * `.agents/scripts/lib/config-settings-schema.js`.
 *
 * Sizing model (Story #3760 — profile-matrix collapse; Story #3874 — one
 * uniform relaxed profile):
 *   - Flat knobs: `softFiles` (~15), `hardFiles` (~30), `maxAcceptance` (~14),
 *     `softAcceptanceCount` (~10). No per-profile ceiling map, no parallel
 *     `testSurface` axis, no selector and no second profile.
 *   - The four-profile `sizingProfile` enum is replaced by a single optional
 *     `wide` declaration carrying a one-line human-readable reason. Declaring
 *     `wide` with a reason lifts the `hardFiles` rejection; no Story is
 *     rejected for width when `wide` is declared.
 *   - Cohesion is the primary heuristic (one Story = one coherent change with
 *     one reason to exist); the numeric ceilings are a backstop. See the
 *     decomposer prompt and authoring SKILL.
