/**
 * lib/orchestration/ceremony-routing.js — ceremony-profile + derived-level
 * acceptance ceremony resolver.
 *
 * The sibling of `review-depth.js#resolveDepth`: it folds the operator ceremony
 * profile and the **derived** change level into a per-cluster ceremony decision
 * for the single-delivery acceptance critic — **fresh-context spawn** vs the
 * contract-identical **inline** critic. It does NOT invent a new risk score and
 * it does NOT own clustering.
 *
 * ## One derived source, two decisions (Story #4542)
 *
 * `derivedLevel` comes from `review-depth.js#deriveChangeLevel` — the same call
 * that feeds review depth — so both ceremony decisions read one observable
 * signal: does the change set touch a sensitive path registered in
 * `audit-rules.json`? Previously this consumed the planner's own risk verdict,
 * which meant a confident all-low self-assertion bought *less* independent
 * checking than authoring nothing at all. A derived level cannot be talked down.
 *
 * ## Ceremony profiles (`delivery.routing.ceremonyProfile`)
 *
 *   - `minimal`  — always `inline` (skip fresh critic + sampling floor).
 *                  Use for tiny N=1 Stories the operator trusts.
 *   - `standard` — level-routed (default). Low → inline (+ sampling floor);
 *                  high → fresh.
 *   - `strict`   — always `fresh` regardless of the derived level.
 *
 * ## The load-bearing invariant (M4-B acceptance floor — DO NOT VIOLATE)
 *
 * Risk-routing chooses fresh-vs-inline **PER CLUSTER**. It NEVER changes the
 * cluster COUNT — the caller owns clustering and hands this module a cluster
 * index. A low-risk Story still gets one verdict per cluster — just possibly
 * authored inline instead of by a fresh sub-agent. This module takes the
 * cluster index as an INPUT and returns a decision for that one cluster; it
 * has no way to add or remove clusters.
 *
 * ## One verdict-owner per cluster (Story #4723)
 *
 * The resolved decision names the cluster's **single verdict owner** via
 * `verdictOwner`: `'fresh-critic'` when the mode is `fresh`,
 * `'inline-self-eval'` when the mode is `inline`. Exactly one pass authors
 * the cluster's verdict — the fresh maker-blind critic OR the
 * contract-identical inline self-eval, never both, and never an additional
 * pre-pass self-assessment before the owner runs. `acceptance-eval.js` is
 * the deterministic SCORER of that one authored verdict (schema validation,
 * round cap, proceed/redraft/block) — it is not a third pass over the
 * criteria. This removes a redundant pass only; it never removes a
 * cluster's verdict (the M4-B floor above holds).
 *
 * ## Tier rules (per cluster, `standard` profile)
 *
 *   - `high` level       → `fresh`   (a sensitive path was touched — a
 *                                     fresh-context maker-blind spawn).
 *   - `low` level        → `inline`  (the contract-identical inline critic),
 *                                     UNLESS the maker-checker sampling floor
 *                                     selects this cluster → `fresh`.
 *   - missing / unknown  → `fresh`   (fail-safe: the diff could not be
 *                                     enumerated, so there is no evidence the
 *                                     change is unremarkable; treat it as
 *                                     needing the full fresh-context ceremony,
 *                                     exactly as `resolveDepth` degrades to
 *                                     `standard` on the same signal).
 *
 * ## Maker-checker sampling floor
 *
 * Even at a `low` derived level under `standard`, a fraction of clusters
 * (`freshCriticSampleRate`, default 0.2) is forced `fresh` so a low level never
 * means zero independent checking. The selection is **deterministic** in the
 * cluster index (a fixed stride), so it is stable across re-runs and —
 * critically — never changes the cluster count: it only re-labels which of
 * the fixed set of clusters run fresh. Profiles `minimal` and `strict`
 * ignore the sampling floor.
 *
 * Pure and total: inputs in, decision out. No I/O, no throws. `null` /
 * `undefined` / malformed inputs degrade to `fresh` + `full` ceremony.
