/**
 * Gather friction signals for the run-scoped roll-up, over the **whole
 * surviving recurrence window** rather than the run's own Stories
 * (Story #4824).
 *
 * The recurrence threshold in `retro-proposals.js` is ≥ 2 occurrences, and
 * the window it was measured over was one run's Story ids. A defect that
 * fires exactly **once per Story** — which is what a systemic framework
 * defect looks like — therefore scored 1 on every Story and was discarded as
 * a singleton, forever. Eighteen consecutive Stories filed nothing.
 *
 * So the gather reduces over every `signals.ndjson` still present under the
 * configured temp root: `<tempRoot>/standalone/stories/story-<sid>/` and
 * `<tempRoot>/run-<eid>/stories/story-<sid>/`. Temp-tree auto-purge
 * shortening that window is acceptable — a short window under-counts, and
 * therefore fails toward *not* filing, which is the safe direction.
 *
 * The run's own Stories are still gathered explicitly first. The discovery
 * walk resolves through the identical path helpers, so it is provably a
 * superset; the explicit pass makes "never fewer signals than before" a
 * property of the code rather than of an argument about path resolution.
 * {@link signalIdentity} de-duplicates the overlap, so one event can never be
 * counted twice and inflate a singleton into a fabricated recurrence.
 *
 * Homed beside {@link gatherStoryFrictionSignals} on purpose: the two used to
 * be independent copies of the same loop in two modules, and they drifted in
 * exactly the way that made the recovery-netting unreachable (Story #4649).
 * One reader, one normalizer, no second place to forget a field.
 *
 * Unusable ids are skipped rather than throwing — a roll-up must not fail the
 * epilogue over one malformed entry.
 *
 * **Bounded by age, not by run (Story #4850).** Widening the window to the
 * whole surviving temp tree also made it unbounded in *time*: a defect fixed
 * weeks ago kept its occurrences on disk and kept re-routing forever, burying
 * a genuine new regression underneath a historical ledger. Rows older than
 * `delivery.feedbackLoop.frictionWindowDays` (default 30) are excluded, as are
 * rows carrying no `ts` a `Date` can read — excluding an undateable row is the
 * direction that fails toward under-counting, and under-counting fails toward
 * not filing. Both exclusions are **counted and reported**, so a caller can
 * tell a bounded window from an unbounded one without reading prose.
 *
 * A recovery marker is written after the incident it cancels, so a marker can
 * never fall outside a window its incident is inside — the netting cannot be
 * broken by the age floor.

/**
 * Capture and persist Story follow-ups. Never throws — the land must not
 * fail because follow-up filing flaked.
 *
 * Story #4543 retired the `captureFollowUpsAfterConfirm` action-gate wrapper
 * (and its `withConfirmFollowUps` sibling) that used to front this function.
 * Re-deriving "did the merge land?" from a confirmation envelope's `action`
 * field was the coupling that made close-and-land — the DEFAULT path — skip
 * capture entirely: the gate only opened on the standalone CLI's `done`, and
 * a belated manual confirm could not backfill because the Story was already
 * `agent::done` (confirm returns `noop`, the gate never opens). The shared
 * land tail (`single-story-close/phases/post-land.js`) now calls this
 * directly, after the merge is already confirmed.
 *
 * @param {object} args
