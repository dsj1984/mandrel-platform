/**
 * lib/orchestration/resolve-stories.js — resolve a set of Story ids into the
 * `{ stories, dag, done }` envelope the delivery scheduler consumes.
 *
 * This is the ONE resolution step for `/deliver`. It generalizes the
 * envelope shaping proven by the retired `resolve-plan-run.js` and fixes the
 * two defects that shipped with it:
 *
 *   - it fetched with `state: 'open'`, so an already-landed sibling vanished
 *     from the envelope and `done[]` could never be populated;
 *   - `done[]` was computed only over label-fetched issues, so a dependency
 *     outside the fetched set could never be satisfied.
 *
 * Both made cross-run, over-time delivery structurally impossible. Here every
 * dependency — in-set or foreign — is resolved against live issue state, so a
 * Story whose blocker landed weeks ago in another plan run is simply ready.
 *
 * Two contracts differ deliberately from the label-scoped ancestor:
 *
 *   1. **Id-scoped fetch means a named non-Story is an ERROR, not a filter.**
 *      `toStoryRecord` used to return `null` for a non-Story, which is right
 *      when a label query returns incidental noise and wrong when an operator
 *      names an id explicitly: silently dropping it yields a partial envelope
 *      that under-delivers without saying so.
 *   2. **The native-edge read fails loud.** See {@link readNativeBlockedBy}.
