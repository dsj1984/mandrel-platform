/**
 * story-deliver-terminal.js — the one terminal envelope every Story
 * close-and-land invocation emits, and the shared next-command vocabulary
 * (Story #4543).
 *
 * Before this module the delivery tail had **two** divergent return
 * contracts, both prose and neither validated:
 * `.agents/workflows/helpers/deliver-story.md` defined one shape and
 * `.agents/agents/story-worker.md` a different one, so a caller could not
 * distinguish a landed Story from a parked one without re-probing GitHub.
 * `story-deliver-terminal.schema.json` is now the SSOT both docs reference
 * rather than restate, and this module is its only writer.
 *
 * Two exports carry the contract:
 *
 *   - {@link buildTerminalEnvelope} assembles and **validates** the envelope.
 *     It throws on a schema violation rather than emitting a malformed
 *     terminal: a silently-wrong terminal is exactly the failure this Story
 *     exists to eliminate, so failing loudly at the writer is the point.
 *   - {@link NEXT_COMMANDS} is the next-command vocabulary shared with
 *     `deliver-recover.js`, so a `pending` envelope and a recovery probe
 *     name the same command for the same state instead of inventing two
 *     dialects for one condition.
 *
 * `TERMINAL_EXIT_CODES` maps status → process exit code. `pending` gets its
 * **own** code (3) precisely so a caller can tell "slow CI, resume me" from
 * "hard block, come look" without parsing stdout — the distinction the
 * pre-#4543 pipeline collapsed by treating budget exhaustion as a block.
