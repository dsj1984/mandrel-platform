 *      the two pre-existing names (`BUNDLE_SIZE_REFRESH`,
 *      `MAINTAINABILITY_REFRESH`) keep working unchanged.
 *   2. Commit tag: a commit in the compared range `<baseRef>..HEAD` whose
 *      subject contains the configured `refreshTag` AND whose diff touches that
 *      kind's baseline file. One-shot by construction — once merged, the
 *      refreshed baseline becomes the base and the tag leaves the range.
 *
 * The tag is matched as a plain substring of a conventional commit subject, so
 * commitlint stays satisfied (e.g. `chore(baselines): baseline-refresh: …`).
 *
 * The two arms are reported separately because Story #5179 scopes them
 * differently: see `applyRefreshAcknowledgment`.
 *

 * `DEFAULT_BASELINE_PATHS` simply skips the commit-tag path rather than
 * throwing, leaving that arm un-acknowledged.

 *   - `improvements` / `unchanged` — present in both, no worse: the rows this

 *      touched.
 *   2. **No post-refresh drift** — a key worse at head than the commit recorded
 *      lands in `drifted`. Drift from commits landing AFTER the refresh is what
 *      "the baseline commit must be the branch's last score-moving commit" asks
 *      for by convention and nothing enforced.
