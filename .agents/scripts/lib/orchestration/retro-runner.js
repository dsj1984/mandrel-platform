/**
 * lib/orchestration/retro-runner.js — In-process Retro module (sequencer).
 *
 * Story #1155 (Epic #1142, 5.40.0) — extracts the helper-driven
 * `epic-retro` invocation into a callable module so the
 * `/deliver` runner can fire Phase E without a separate LLM
 * helper turn. (Story #2259, Epic #2172: the legacy deliver-runner
 * CLI was retired once delivery moved entirely into the slash
 * command.) The retro fires before `/deliver`'s finalize step
 * opens the PR — the operator's PR-merge is the final human gate, not
 * the retro itself.
 *
 * Story #3001 — the runner body was decomposed into `./retro/phases/`
 * (one file per functional unit) following the established pattern at
 * `./git-cleanup/phases/`, `./story-close/phases/`, and
 * `./post-merge/phases/`. This file is now a thin sequencer that owns
 * the `runRetro` entry point and re-exports the phase-level helpers so
 * existing import sites stay unchanged.
 *
 * Public API:
 *   - `runRetro({ epicId, provider, logger })` → `{ posted, compact, scorecard, body, defectClasses }`.
 *   - `composeRetroBody(input)` (pure, exported for tests).
 *   - `gatherRetroSignals({ epicId, provider })` (exported for tests).
 *   - `appendChecksSection(body, findings)` (pure, exported for tests).
 *   - `deriveDefectClasses(routedProposals)` (pure, exported for tests).
 *
 * Story #4135 (Epic #4131, F11) — the runner now derives a
 * **recurring-defect-class signal** from the routed-proposal actionable
 * items (categories that recurred ≥2 times across review/deliver-caught
 * friction, or a force-flagged `agent::blocked` category). The derived
 * classes ride on the `runRetro` envelope as `defectClasses[]` and are
 * stamped onto the proposed `gh issue create` commands as `friction::<class>`
 * labels (the routed-proposals composer already emits that label), which is
 * the durable substrate the `/plan` Phase 0 prior-feedback fetcher reads
 * back to surface recurring classes to the planner. The derivation is
 * **no-op-safe**: absent or empty routed proposals yield an empty array and
 * no behavioural change to the existing retro/post path.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - Reads child Stories' `story-perf-summary` comments to aggregate
 *     `frictionByCategory` totals (Story #1046 unified-summary path).
 *   - Reads child Stories' label sets to count HITL pause events
 *     (`agent::blocked`).
 *   - Reads the Epic's `parked-follow-ons` structured comment for the
 *     parked + recut counts (with a fallback to per-Story body grep on the
 *     `<!-- recut-of: #N -->` marker).
 *   - Selects the compact (clean-manifest) or full retro shape via
 *     `isCleanManifest`.
 *   - Posts the composed markdown as a `retro` structured comment on the
 *     Epic, terminated with the `retro-complete: <ISO>` HTML marker.
 *   - **Never** routes through `notify.js` — GitHub is the sole retro
 *     archive; the webhook must not see the retro body.

/**
 * Public: compose and post the retro structured comment on the Epic.
 *
 * Story #1290 (Epic #1143) — at /deliver Phase 5, the runner invokes
 * the self-healing checks registry with `scope: 'retro'` and
 * `autoFix: false`. The retro is **read-only by construction**: the
 * registry runner enforces the invariant by throwing if any caller flips
 * `autoFix: true` under `scope: 'retro'`. Findings are appended to the
 * retro body via `appendChecksSection`, which suppresses the section when
 * findings are empty so the compact "🟢 Clean sprint" shape is preserved.
 *
 * Story #2252 — when `opts.bus` is supplied the runner emits
 * `retro.start` immediately on entry and `retro.end` immediately before
 * returning the envelope. On throw the helper emits `retro.end` with
 * `posted: false` before re-throwing so the ledger always carries the
 * closing boundary.
