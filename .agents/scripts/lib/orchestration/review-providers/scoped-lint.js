/**
 * review-providers/scoped-lint.js — the scoped-lint surface of the native
 * review provider (extracted from `native.js` by Story #4839).
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * The scoped-lint gate reported `executionFailed` — and therefore emitted zero
 * findings while the review reported clean — on 18 of 23 Beestera/swarm-os
 * Stories carrying friction (78%) and on 5 mandrel Stories. Measured
 * 2026-07-29, the cause was **not** environmental and **not** a parse failure.
 * Three defects in how the runners were invoked and reconciled produced the
 * same symptom:
 *
 * 1. **The markdown runner was never resolvable.** The provider spawned
 *    `npx --no markdownlint`, but the binary this project (and the consumer)
 *    installs is `markdownlint-cli2` — `markdownlint-cli2` is the package and
 *    the bin name; a bare `markdownlint` bin does not exist. `npx --no` with an
 *    unresolvable bin exits 1 printing `could not determine executable to run`
 *    and nothing else, so the summary parsed nothing and the gate degraded.
 *    The parser was already written for **cli2's** `Summary: N error(s)` line,
 *    so the invocation and the parser had never agreed. The `--ignore
 *    node_modules` flag was likewise `markdownlint-cli` (v1) syntax, which
 *    cli2 does not accept. Fix: resolve the runner from what is actually
 *    installed and pass each candidate its own argument shape.
 *
 * 2. **One runner's failure poisoned the other's verdict.** The two runs were
 *    folded into a *single* `parseLintOutput` call over concatenated output and
 *    the maximum exit status. So the unresolvable markdown runner's exit 1
 *    became the verdict for biome too: any change set containing at least one
 *    `.md` file degraded the whole gate whenever biome itself had nothing to
 *    report — i.e. exactly the clean case the gate exists to confirm. Fix:
 *    classify each surface independently and merge structurally.
 *
 * 3. **Biome's "nothing in scope" exit was read as a failure.** `biome lint`
 *    exits 1 with `No files were processed in the specified paths.` when every
 *    supplied path is excluded by `biome.json` (`temp/`, `dist/`,
 *    `.worktrees/`, anything in the VCS ignore file). That is an empty scope,
 *    not a runner that could not execute. Fix: recognise the sentinel.
 *
 * ## What a degraded surface now produces
 *
 * `runScopedLint` still reports `executionFailed` — the friction-telemetry
 * emission in `native.js` is deliberately unchanged (Story #4699 routed an
 * unexecutable tool to telemetry so severity tiers reflect code findings only,
 * and that intent stands). It additionally reports a `degradations[]` array
 * naming **which** surface could not run and **why**, so the review outcome can
 * say "this gate did not run" instead of silently reading clean.
 *
 * ## The code surface never got the same treatment (Story #5193)
 *
 * Story #4839 gave the *markdown* surface a disk probe and left the code
 * surface spawning `npx --no biome` and classifying the exit code. On npm 11.x
 * that spawn exits **0 with empty output** when biome is absent, so
 * `parseLintOutput` saw no failure, produced no degradation, and the surface
 * contributed `errors: 0, warnings: 0` — a *silent false clean*, which is
 * strictly worse than a degradation: a degraded surface announces itself, a
 * falsely-clean one is trusted. Since nothing in the framework requires either
 * runner, "absent" is the default state of a consumer checkout.
 *
 * Fix: runner resolution is a **precondition** for every surface, not an
 * outcome inferred from an exit code. Both surfaces now resolve through
 * {@link resolveRunner}, and an unresolved runner is never spawned.
 *
 * The same measurement invalidated the `NPX_UNRESOLVABLE` sentinel: current npm
 * answers an unresolvable bin with `npm error code E404`, not `could not
 * determine executable to run`, so every genuinely-unresolvable runner was
 * being labelled `unparseable-output`. The sentinel now recognises both shapes.
 * It still earns its keep after the disk probe: the probe only sees
 * `node_modules/.bin`, so a runner resolvable some other way can still fail.
