/**
 * review-providers/native.js — Native (in-process) ReviewProvider adapter.
 *
 * Story #2833 (Epic #2815) — extracts the findings-collection logic that
 * previously lived in the retired `.agents/scripts/epic-code-review` CLI into a
 * `ReviewProvider`-shaped adapter. The adapter:
 *
 *   1. Diffs `headRef` against `baseRef` to enumerate changed files.
 *   2. Runs scoped lint (biome + markdownlint) over the changed surface.
 *   3. Computes per-file maintainability reports for changed JS files.
 *   4. Maps each signal to a `Finding` with a `severity` ∈ {critical, high,
 *      medium, suggestion}.
 *
 * The adapter does NOT post to GitHub, does NOT render a markdown body,
 * and does NOT consult the lifecycle bus. Those concerns belong to
 * `runCodeReview()` (which calls the renderer + the structured-comment
 * upserter) and the listener chain.
 *
 * Construction is intentionally zero-arg so the factory can instantiate
 * it without threading config through every call. Per-invocation config
 * (paths, runners, evidence store) is injected via the `runReview` arg or
 * the `createNativeProvider({ deps })` overload used by tests.
 *
 * **Depth is deliberately ignored here (Story #3937).** The pluggable review
 * contract threads a risk-derived `depth` lever (`light` / `standard` /
 * `deep`) on `ReviewInput` so LLM-backed providers can dial their thoroughness
 * up or down with the Epic's judged risk. This native adapter does not read
 * `input.depth` and does not branch on it: its work is a *mechanical* lint +
 * maintainability sweep whose cost already scales with the diff — every
 * changed file is linted once and every changed JS file is scored once,
 * regardless of risk tier. There is no "review harder" knob a deterministic
 * scorer can turn: a high-risk diff and a low-risk diff of the same size do
 * exactly the same amount of work. The contract is therefore explicit rather
 * than silently dropping the field — `depth` is a no-op for this provider by
 * design, and the LLM-backed providers (codex, security-review, ultrareview)
 * are where the lever actually changes behaviour.
 *
 * @typedef {import('./types.js').Finding} Finding
 * @typedef {import('./types.js').ReviewInput} ReviewInput
