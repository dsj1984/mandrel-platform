/**
 * phases/wrong-tree-guard.js — detect worktree/main-checkout edit divergence.
 *
 * Story #3364 — `/single-story-deliver` (and `/deliver`) materializes a
 * per-Story worktree and instructs the agent to `cd` into it before editing.
 * On Windows that guidance is silently insufficient: `cd <workCwd>` steers the
 * Bash tool's working directory, but the path-based Edit/Write tools operate on
 * absolute paths and ignore cwd. An agent whose shell is correctly inside the
 * worktree can still resolve a main-checkout absolute path and edit the wrong
 * tree — the two surfaces disagree and nothing detects it.
 *
 * Failure mode this guards: the worktree is the intended work tree, but the
 * agent's edits landed under the main checkout instead. `single-story-close.js`
 * runs its gates against the worktree only, so it would commit an unchanged /
 * partial worktree (gates pass on the clean tree) while leaving the main
 * checkout dirty — a silent empty-diff PR.
 *
 * Detection: when a worktree is the active work tree (it exists on disk and is
 * distinct from `cwd`), inspect `git -C <mainCheckout> status --porcelain`. Any
 * **tracked-path** change (modified, staged, deleted, renamed) in the main
 * checkout is the candidate wrong-tree signal. Untracked files (`??`) are
 * ignored — they are scratch artifacts, not relocated Story work, and flagging
 * them would produce false positives on every run.
 *
 * Story #4424 — the raw "main checkout is dirty" signal is too coarse for
 * multi-session operation: uncommitted tracked-path changes in the main
 * checkout can belong to a **different concurrent session** and have nothing to
 * do with the Story being closed (framework-gap #4420). The guard therefore
 * intersects the main-checkout stray tracked paths with the **Story's own
 * diff-path set** (paths changed on the worktree branch vs the base branch,
 * plus the worktree's uncommitted tracked changes):
 *   - **Overlap non-empty** → genuine wrong-tree signal: post a `friction`
 *     comment and throw (abort close), exactly as before.
 *   - **Disjoint** (Story diff-path set non-empty, no shared path) → another
 *     session's business: post a `friction` comment whose wording states close
 *     PROCEEDED and names the disjoint stray files (telemetry for
 *     concurrent-session hygiene), then return without throwing.
 *   - **Empty Story diff-path set** with stray paths → keep the abort (the
 *     #3364 silent empty-diff backstop; an empty set makes every stray path
 *     disjoint-by-definition, which must not downgrade the guard).
 *   - **Story-diff probe failure** with stray paths present → fall back to the
 *     coarse abort rather than fail-open, so a probe hiccup never converts a
 *     would-be abort into a silent pass.
 *
 * The main-checkout status probe keeps its fail-open semantics: a probe failure
 * downgrades to a warning and skips the guard — it never blocks an otherwise
 * valid close.
