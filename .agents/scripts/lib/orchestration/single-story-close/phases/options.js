 *   1. `--no-wait-merge` / injected opt-out — always wins.
 *   2. **Operator owns the merge** (`--no-auto-merge`, or
 *      `delivery.ci.autoMerge: "strict"`): the PR was deliberately left

 *      surfaces; waiting would only burn the poll budget and then block a
 *      perfectly healthy Story. An explicit `--wait-merge` cannot override
 *      this — you cannot land-in-one-close a PR you refused to arm — so the
 *      caller is told rather than silently ignored.
