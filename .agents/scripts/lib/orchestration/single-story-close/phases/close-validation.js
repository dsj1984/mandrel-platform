/**
 * phases/close-validation.js — run the canonical close-validation gate
 * chain for a standalone Story.
 *
 * The standalone path uses the same `runCloseValidation` chain as
 * Epic-attached Stories so the experience matches — only the baseline
 * ref changes (`main`, not `epic/<id>`).
 *
 * Standalone evidence keyspace (Story #4250). Standalone Stories have no
 * parent Epic, so they cannot scope a `validation-evidence.json` under a
 * `temp/run-<id>/` tree. Rather than feed a null `epicId` into the
 * Epic-keyed path (which structurally disabled the evidence cache and
 * forced every re-run — base-sync conflict, review remediation, baseline
 * absorb — to re-execute ALL gates including the coverage suite), the
 * standalone close now passes `standalone: true`. `runCloseValidation`
 * then anchors the cache on the Story id alone at
 * `temp/standalone/stories/story-<id>/validation-evidence.json`, so a
 * second close at unchanged HEAD short-circuits the already-passed gates.
 *
 * Format-autofix self-heal (Story #4250). The Epic path runs
 * `runScopedFormatAutofix` before the check-only gates so benign JSON/YAML
 * drift the formatter can fix is folded into a `fix(story-close):` commit
 * rather than hard-failing the format gate. The standalone path now does
 * the same, with `baseBranch` as the diff anchor and the Story worktree as
 * the commit target.
 *
 * `runCloseValidation`, `buildDefaultGates`, and `runScopedFormatAutofix`
 * are accepted as injected dependencies so the parent CLI's cache-busted
 * bindings win in tests that mock the upstream module URLs.

/**
 * Run the close-validation gate chain. Throws on first gate failure.
 *
 * Order (Story #4250): format-autofix self-heal → close-validation gates.
 * The autofix step scopes the formatter to the `baseBranch...storyBranch`
 * diff, commits any fix on the Story branch inside the Story worktree, and
 * is best-effort — a missing `storyBranch` (resume/legacy callers) skips it
 * with a log line rather than failing.
 *
 * Gates are built from the canonical resolved config (`buildDefaultGates`
 * reads `project.commands` and `delivery.quality.gates.crap.enabled`); the
 * `baseBranch` is forwarded as the gate `baseBranch` so the format gate's
 * changed-file scope anchors on it. `standalone: true` routes the evidence
 * cache to the storyId-anchored keyspace.
