 * on an exhausted merge-wait budget, is friction the retro must see, and
 * routing it through the single emitter means no terminal path can forget
 * it. `emitTerminalFriction` decides what (if anything) is worth a record —
 * see `frictionForTerminal` for why `blocked` and a `--no-wait-merge`
 * `pending` are deliberately NOT flagged here.
 *
 * Async, and awaited by every caller: the CLI exits via `process.exit` the
 * moment `main` resolves, so a fire-and-forget append would be discarded.
 * The emit is best-effort internally and cannot throw.

 * Story #4257 — run a blocked-prone phase and, if it throws, release the

 *
 * The two recoverable-blocked close exits (base-sync conflict in
 * `runBaseSyncPhase`, and a critical-blocker review halt in
 * `openAndReviewPr`) throw before the clean-close lease release at the
 * tail of `runSingleStoryClose`, stranding the operator's lease
 * indefinitely. The standalone lease does **not** expire by TTL: it is
 * fail-closed by design (`lease-guard-shared.js` anchors `heartbeatAt` to
 * now, so `isClaimLive` is true for any foreign assignee regardless of the
 * configured TTL), so a stranded claim is cleared only by `--steal` or
 * de-assignment. That fail-closed-refuses a different operator who picks up
 * the blocked Story — exactly the hand-off case. Releasing here closes
 * that gap.
 *
 * The original throw is preserved verbatim (per
 * `rules/orchestration-error-handling.md` — throw, never `Logger.fatal`),
 * so the CLI boundary still maps it to a non-zero exit; the lease release
 * must not swallow it. `releaseLease` is itself best-effort and never
 * throws, so it cannot mask the real failure. Fail-closed re-acquire
 * semantics are preserved: `releaseStoryLease` no-ops when the operator no
 * longer holds the claim, and a self-held re-acquire on a re-run still
 * succeeds against the now-unclaimed ticket.

  // time its PR was in flight — and forever on the operator-merge path, where
  // nothing downstream ever re-claimed it. The release now belongs to the
  // post-land tail, which runs only on a CONFIRMED merge and which both
  // landing surfaces reach. Every non-merged ending below — the
  // `merge.unlanded` block, an exhausted wait budget, `--no-wait-merge`,
  // `--no-auto-merge` — deliberately RETAINS the claim: the PR is open and the
  // work still has an owner. The only releases that survive here are
  // `releaseLeaseOnBlock`'s two throwing exits above, which fire before the PR
  // is ever armed (Story #4257's hand-off property).

  // Close-and-land (Story #4428; default since `delivery.routing.closeAndLand`
  // — Story #4539): poll the just-armed PR to merge confirmation, or block
  // explicitly with `merge.unlanded`, instead of resting at `agent::closing`.
  // This is the DEFAULT path for attended and headless runs alike.
  //
  // Resolved here rather than at parse time because two inputs do not exist
  // until now: the resolved config (whose cwd the parse produces) and the
  // actual arm outcome. A PR the operator deliberately left un-armed
  // (`--no-auto-merge` / `autoMerge: "strict"`) has nothing to land, so it
  // rests at `agent::closing` for the human instead of burning the poll
  // budget and then blocking a healthy Story.
