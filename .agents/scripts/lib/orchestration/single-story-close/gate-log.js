/**
 * single-story-close/gate-log.js — bounded gate output for the close path
 * (Story #4736).
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * `runCloseValidation` streams every child gate's stdout/stderr line through
 * an injected `log`, and the close phase used to hand it `Logger.info` — whose
 * default sink is `console.log`. A single successful close therefore wrote the
 * whole of `npm test`, the linter, and the baseline checks onto the invoking
 * agent's stdout: ~50KB, over the host's inline tool-result ceiling. The caller
 * got a truncated preview, had to open the persisted file anyway, and re-ran
 * close for a clean envelope — burning the run's most expensive stretch to
 * re-derive output it already had.
 *
 * Story #4708 set the contract this restores compliance with (see
 * `rules/orchestration-error-handling.md` § Output Contract): compact digest
 * plus an on-disk artifact path, ≤ ~2KB on the **default success path**.
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * A sink captures every gate line to a log under the gitignored temp tree and
 * emits nothing inline. What happens next depends on the outcome, because the
 * two outcomes want opposite things:
 *
 *   - **success** — the caller wants the verdict, not the evidence.
 *     {@link GateLogSink#digest} is one line: the pass count and the log path.
 *   - **failure** — the evidence IS the point, and making the caller open a
 *     file to see why a gate went red just moves the cost.
 *     {@link GateLogSink#replay} puts the captured tail back inline.
 *
 * `AGENT_LOG_LEVEL=verbose` opts back into live inline streaming (the
 * "existing log-level control"): the capture still happens, so the artifact is
 * written either way.
 *
 * The sink never throws. A log directory that cannot be written degrades to
 * inline streaming — losing the size bound is strictly better than losing the
 * gate output that says why a close failed.
 *
 * ## Why the artifact is written asynchronously (Story #4766)
 *
 * This sink is the `log` callable that `close-validation/process.js` invokes
 * from inside the gate child's stdout/stderr `'data'` handler — once per line.
 * The first cut wrote each line with `fs.writeSync`, which blocks the event
 * loop while the child keeps writing: the OS pipe buffer fills, the child's
 * write fails with `EAGAIN`, and a child that does not tolerate that dies. On
 * a clean `main` `biome ci .` already emits ~625 lines, and it aborts with
 * exit 101 (a `biome_console` panic, not a lint violation) when it happens —
 * so the first gate of any close could die on plumbing while its verdict was
 * green.
 *
 * So the write path buffers into an async stream instead: per-line work is
 * O(1) and never touches a syscall on the drain path. The cost is that the
 * artifact is not on disk the instant a line is logged, which is why the sink
 * exposes {@link GateLogSink#flush} — callers await it before reading,
 * replaying, or naming the artifact as final.
