/**
 * lib/orchestration/light-escalation.js — what the light path does when it
 * refuses a scope (Story #4856).
 *
 * Three behaviors, each previously missing, and each about a refusal rather
 * than a verdict — the verdicts live in
 * {@link module:lib/orchestration/light-suitability}:
 *
 *   1. **Recycling the receipt.** A blocked diff backstop used to tell the
 *      operator to "escalate to `/plan`", which authored a brand-new Story and
 *      left the receipt open with no successor — orphaning its branch, its
 *      worktree, and a finished implementation. Naming the receipt as `/plan`'s
 *      *input* recycles it instead: tickets mode already fetches a ticket,
 *      rewrites it into properly-planned Stories, and closes the source as
 *      superseded.
 *
 *      Deferring receipt creation until after the backstop would be the other
 *      fix, and is deliberately not taken: the issue id is load-bearing in
 *      `single-story-init.js` (the assignee lease, the `story-<id>` branch, the
 *      label state machine) and in the `(refs #<id>)` commit subject.
 *
 *   2. **Telemetering the refusal.** Neither light-path rejection emitted any
 *      signal, so an over-tight ceiling could only reach the framework as
 *      anecdote — which is exactly how the `maxFiles: 4` defect surfaced. The
 *      roll-up aggregates by category, so recording these makes the ceilings
 *      recalibratable from evidence.
 *
 *   3. **Preserving the refused work** ({@link preserveRefusedWork}, Story
 *      #4875). A refusal used to leave a finished implementation on a local
 *      `story-<id>` branch with no remote ref — the one shape routine branch
 *      and worktree cleanup is entitled to delete. The branch is published to
 *      `origin` (no PR, no merge) so the recycle command has something to
 *      recycle.
 *
 * Telemetry is best-effort by construction: a signals-write failure must never
 * change a gate's verdict.
