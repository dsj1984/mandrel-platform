 * repo joins escomplex methods to istanbul coverage moves neither. Rows
 * scored by the pre-#4775 join (exact transpiled-line equality, methods
 * dropped when unresolved) are not comparable to rows scored by the join
 * that replaced it (original-source coordinates, containment matching,
 * honest `requireCoverage: false`): the same method can carry a different
 * `crap`, a different `startLine`, or exist in one baseline and not the
 * other. Comparing across that boundary produces phantom regressions and,
 * worse, phantom passes.
 *
 * The stamp makes the boundary explicit and fails closed. Bump it whenever
 * the coverage join, the line coordinate system, the unresolved-method policy,
 * or the **method identity rule** changes.
 *
 * Story #4969 bumped it to `method-identity-v3` for the last of those. An
 * anonymous method used to be keyed by escomplex's `<anon method-N>` ordinal
 * and is now keyed by its enclosing-scope path; 34.6% of rows changed identity
 * in one step. Rows keyed the old way and rows keyed the new way describe the
 * same functions under different names, so pairing them is exactly the
 * mis-keyed join this stamp exists to refuse — hence the bump, which is what
 * makes the migration report nothing rather than a wall of phantom verdicts.
 *
 * Deliberately module-local: `envelopeExtras()` is the single production door
 * to this value, so exporting the bare constant would add a second entry
 * point that nothing in production reaches. Callers and tests that need the
 * string read it off `envelopeExtras().scoringSemantics`.

 *   2. **drifted**      — same (file, method) but startLine shifted. Uses
 *                         the closest line-drifted baseline row under the
 *                         same no-regression rule. A drift without
 *                         regression is reported informationally.
 *   3. **incomparable** — same (file, method), but the two rows express
 *                         their startLine in DIFFERENT coordinate systems
 *                         (Story #4866). Reported, never scored.
 *   4. **new**          — no baseline match. Violates if crap > ceiling.
 *   5. **removed**      — baseline rows not seen in the current scan.
 *                         Surfaced only; never a failure.
 *
 * **Why the incomparable bucket exists.** The drift heuristic assumes both
 * rows measure the same axis and the method simply moved along it. When one
 * row's line is an original-source coordinate and the other's is a transpiled
 * one, the "distance" it minimises over is the gap between two coordinate
 * systems, not a code movement — so it pairs rows arbitrarily and then scores
 * the pairing. That is precisely how a scan that changed nothing reports a
 * regression no edit can satisfy. Refusing is the only sound answer: a row
 * whose provenance differs from every candidate's is counted and surfaced,
 * and it does NOT fall through to the new-method arm (it is not new; it is
 * unmeasurable against this baseline).
 *
 * **`provenanceMismatched` is captured BEFORE the provenance filter runs**
 * (Story #4871). `incomparable` only counts rows where *every* candidate
 * disagreed on coordinates; a row with one agreeing candidate and three
 * disagreeing ones scores normally and leaves no trace. That made the
 * evidence of coordinate mixing strictly narrower than the mixing itself —
 * and the unsound-basis backstop, which needs exactly that evidence, had
 * nothing sound to read. The counter below is incremented for **any** row
 * with at least one provenance-mismatched candidate, whichever arm then
 * resolves it.
 *
 * **Unscorable rows never reach an arm.** A row the scan could not score
 * (`crap: null` / `coverage: null`, or an explicit `unscorable: true`) carries
 * no measurement to compare. It is bucketed and counted, and it is excluded
 * from `comparable` so it cannot dilute any ratio derived from this result.
