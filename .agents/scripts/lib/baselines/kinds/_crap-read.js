/**
 * _crap-read.js — the CRAP baseline read path (Story #5002).
 *
 * Underscore-prefixed like `_shared-metric.js`: a helper for the per-kind
 * modules in this directory, not a kind of its own. `kinds/crap.js` re-exports
 * `loadCrapBaseline` so existing importers keep one door.
 *
 * **This module is the whole read path, and there is only one.** `crap-utils.js`
 * used to carry a second one — `projectCrapEnvelopeToLegacy` plus its
 * `COMPAT_STAMP_*` allow-lists — so `check-baselines` (through
 * `baselines/reader.js`) and the `quality-preview` pre-commit arm (through that
 * projection) fed the same compat axes from two hand-maintained field lists. A
 * stamp added to one and not the other yielded two opposite verdicts on one
 * envelope, three times over: Story #4866 (`scoringSemantics`,
 * `tsTranspilerVersion`), #4969 (`rows[].anonymous`), #4986
 * (`provenanceStamped`). Every one of those axes keys on a POSITIVE marker, so
 * a dropped field read `undefined` and failed the baseline closed with a remedy
 * that could not work — re-deriving it wrote the stamp the read path then
 * discarded. With one reader that drift class is structurally impossible, so no
 * allow-list needs maintaining.

/**
 * Read the committed CRAP baseline off the working tree through
 * `baselines/reader.js` and project it onto the `file`-keyed shape the
 * comparator and the compat axes consume.
 *
 * `baselinePath` selects the explicit-path reader variant (the worktree /
 * epic-ref callers always know their own path); without one the reader
 * resolves the configured location for the `crap` kind itself.
 *
 * `escomplexVersion` is back-filled from the running scorer exactly as the
 * deleted projection stamped it — the v2 envelope does not carry the field, and
 * `escomplex-mismatch` is a fatal axis, so omitting it would fail every
 * baseline closed on a value that was never on disk.
 *
 * Returns `null` on any read/parse/schema failure; the preview gate maps that
 * to "no baseline" and fails open, as it always did.
 *
 * Deliberately module-local: `loadCrapBaseline`'s `readFromTree` default is the
 * single production door to it, and tests inject their own loader.
