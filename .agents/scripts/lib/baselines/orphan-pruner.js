//
// Story #5012 — the measurement-free remedy that makes hard-failing on a stale
// baseline row defensible.
//
// The scope gate (`check-baseline-scope.js`) blocks a PR that leaves a row
// pointing at a file it deleted. A hard gate is only fair while its remedy is
// cheap, and the existing remedy — re-run the scorer, re-derive the baseline —
// costs a full coverage run or a full-tree MI re-score for what is arithmetic
// on a row set. This pruner is that arithmetic.
//
// ## Measurement-free by contract
//
// Three prohibitions, each guarding a way the file could start lying:
//
//   1. **Never add a row.** Adding one means claiming a measurement nobody
//      took. Producing rows stays the producers' exclusive job.
//   2. **Never restamp `generatedAt`.** A fresh stamp over rows nobody
//      re-measured is precisely the failure an age check exists to catch — the
//      envelope would claim to describe today's tree on the strength of a
//      deletion. The pruner carries the original stamp through untouched.
//   3. **Never delete a row it cannot prove inert.** Only two classes qualify:
//      the file is absent from disk, or the file is no longer matched by the
//      gate's own `targetDirs` / `ignoreGlobs`. Everything else survives.
//
// ## Degrade, never guess
//
// A degraded inventory (`files: null` — unreadable `.c8rc.cjs`, absent
// `targetDirs`) means scope is unknown, not empty. Treating it as empty would
// make every row look out-of-scope and hand the pruner the whole baseline. So
// an unreadable scope config falls back to **orphan-only** pruning: the
// absent-from-disk class still resolves off the filesystem and is still safe,
// while the out-of-scope class is suspended until scope can be read again.
