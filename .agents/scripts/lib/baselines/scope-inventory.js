// .agents/scripts/lib/baselines/scope-inventory.js
//
// Story #5012 — the ONE in-scope file inventory the honesty surface reads.
//
// A ratchet gate can be green while measuring almost nothing: nothing checks
// that a committed baseline's row set still describes the tree it claims to
// describe. Both instruments that now do — `check-baseline-scope.js` (assert)
// and `prune-baseline-orphans.js` (remedy) — resolve "which files is this kind
// supposed to have rows for?" through this module, so the gate and the pruner
// cannot disagree about scope and start fighting each other.
//
// ## Recompute from the gate's own config, never from a second walker
//
// The inventory is derived from **the same configuration the kind's refresh
// scorer reads**, through the same helpers:
//
//   - `coverage` — `.c8rc.cjs` `include` / `exclude`, applied with
//     `coverage-baseline.js#buildScopePredicate`, exactly as
//     `refresh-service.js#buildDefaultCoverageScorer` does.
//   - every other file-keyed kind — `delivery.quality.gates.<kind>.targetDirs`
//     / `.ignoreGlobs`, walked with `maintainability-utils.js#scanDirectory`,
//     exactly as `refresh-service.js#buildDefaultMaintainabilityScorer` does.
//
// A second walker written here would report the two implementations
// disagreeing as divergence — the same failure mode
// `check-baseline-drift.js` avoids by re-scoring through
// `resolveDefaultScorer` rather than a private scorer.
//
// ## Measurement-free by contract
//
// Nothing in this module runs a scorer, reads `coverage/coverage-final.json`,
// or needs a test run to have happened. It walks directories and matches
// globs. That is what makes the gate runnable on any checkout, which is in
// turn what makes hard-failing on a stale row defensible.

/**
 * Per-kind classification of which divergence directions may be asserted.
 *
 * **Only a kind whose producer emits one row per in-scope file may assert the
 * MISSING direction.** This is not a conservatism knob — it is arithmetic.
 * Measured against this repository on 2026-08-05, asserting MISSING densely
 * yields 128 phantom rows for `crap` (rows are per-method and coverage-gated,
 * so a file with no scorable method legitimately has none) and 510 for
 * `duplication` (a row exists only where a clone was found). A gate that
 * reports 638 phantom findings on a healthy tree is a gate nobody reads.
 *
 * `lint` and `mutation` are sparse for the same reason — a clean file has no
 * lint row, an untested file has no mutation row. `lighthouse` (keyed on
 * `route`) and `bundle-size` (keyed on `bundle`) are not file-keyed at all, so
 * neither direction is meaningful: their keys name artefacts, not paths on
 * disk, and a directory walk can say nothing about them.
