/**
 * knip-entry-sync.js — derive which top-level `.agents/scripts/*.js` CLIs are
 * actually invoked, and diff that set against the `entry` array of whatever
 * configuration knip itself would load (Story #5039; #5026 could only read a
 * literal `knip.json`).
 *
 * Why this exists (Story #5001 → the #5012 near-miss):
 *
 * #5001 replaced the blanket `.agents/scripts/*.js!` entry glob with an
 * explicit list, precisely so that a top-level CLI **nothing invokes** stops
 * being declared live by the glob and surfaces as dead. It simultaneously
 * promoted knip's `files` rule to `error`, so whole-file death now produces
 * `{ file, symbol: '*' }` baseline rows.
 *
 * That pairing has a silent failure mode. A CLI added *after* #5001 is not in
 * the hand-written list, so knip reads it as unreachable and emits a whole-file
 * row for it — plus transitive rows for every lib module only that CLI imports.
 * During #5012's delivery this produced 5 false rows (`check-baseline-scope.js`,
 * `prune-baseline-orphans.js`, and their three `lib/baselines/*` modules). The
 * natural remedy — accept the ratchet's diff — would have permanently recorded
 * live, working operator CLIs as expected-dead, blinding the ratchet to their
 * real death later. It was caught only because a base-sync conflict forced a
 * manual read of the diff.
 *
 * The fix is to stop depending on a human remembering to edit the config.
 * #5001's own wording already names the derivation rule — entries are derived
 * "from what package.json scripts, husky hooks, .github/workflows, and the
 * .agents workflow/skill markdown actually invoke". This module mechanizes
 * exactly that rule and asserts it in both directions:
 *
 *   missing — invoked by a real caller but absent from `entry`. This is the
 *     #5012 bug: knip will call it dead and the ratchet will offer to record
 *     the lie.
 *   stale — listed in `entry` but invoked by nothing. This is the blind spot
 *     #5001 closed: a declared entry point is immortal, so its death can never
 *     surface.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a filesystem-derived list. Restoring `.agents/scripts/*.js!`
 * — or regenerating the array from `readdirSync` — would make every file live
 * by construction and undo #5001's AC-2. Liveness here means *invoked*, not
 * *present*.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT conferred by documentation prose. `.agents/docs/**` and
 * `docs/**` describe operator-run commands; a paragraph naming a CLI is not a
 * caller. Three CLIs are named only in prose today
 * (`check-baseline-drift.js`, `post-structured-comment.js`,
 * `provision-git-hooks.js`) and #5001 recorded all of them as whole-file dead
 * rows on purpose. Counting prose would silently resurrect them.
 *
 * A CLI that is only *imported* by another script (`cleanup-repo-test-temp.js`,
 * imported by `run-tests.js` and `run-coverage.js`) is correctly neither: it is
 * reachable through the module graph from a real entry, so knip already sees it
 * and it must not be declared an entry point of its own.
