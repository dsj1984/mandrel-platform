/**
 * lib/wave-runner/ready-set.js — the path-agnostic ready-set scheduling
 * core.
 *
 * This module is the scheduling kernel the v2 `/mandrel-deliver` multi-Story path
 * dispatches through (`stories-wave-tick.js`). It replaces wave-*batch* selection
 * (group N must fully drain before group N+1 opens) with *continuous*,
 * dependency-driven selection: a Story becomes dispatchable the instant
 * **its own** dependencies are satisfied, regardless of whether unrelated
 * Stories in some nominal wave are still running. There is no false
 * barrier — a Story C that depends only on a done Story A is selected even
 * while an unrelated Story B is still pending.
 *
 * It is deliberately **path-agnostic and side-effect-free**: it neither
 * reads GitHub, the lifecycle ledger, nor a checkpoint, and it dispatches
 * nothing. Callers supply the live Story records (already fetched), the
 * resolved `inFlight` count, and the `globalCap`, and receive back the set
 * of Stories that are safe to dispatch on this beat. The
 * `stories-wave-tick.js` adapter wires this core; this module does not
 * modify that CLI surface.
 *
 * The scheduling surface:
 *   - `classifyStory(story)` — live-label classifier mapping a Story
 *     record's labels + issue state to one of `done | blocked | executing |
 *     ready`. Mirrors the done-predicate this module uses
 *     (`agent::done` OR closed issue) so a Story closed manually through
 *     the GitHub UI is recognised as done.
 *   - `storiesOverlap(a, b)` — the **beat-local** file-overlap co-dispatch
 *     guard: true when two Stories' file footprints intersect. Two Stories
 *     that would touch the same file MUST NOT be admitted onto parallel
 *     `story-<id>` branches on the same beat (they would race the same path
 *     and produce a merge conflict at close). The comparison runs over
 *     the **widened** footprint (`storyWidenedFootprint`) — a declared
 *     `changes[]` is treated as a lower bound and widened from the paths the
 *     Story's own text names, because a guard that trusts a prediction cannot
 *     prevent the collision nobody predicted (Story #4875).
 *   - `planReadySet({ stories, doneIds, inFlight, globalCap,
 *     inFlightRecords })` — the scheduler. Returns the deterministic,
 *     overlap-free dispatch set (capped at `globalCap − inFlight`) **and**
 *     the Stories it withheld because a **concrete** path in their footprint
 *     is reserved by a Story still in flight from an earlier beat.
 *
 * The two guards deliberately draw the glob/UNKNOWN class differently
 * (Story #4960). Within a beat an unknown-width footprint overlaps
 * everything, because admitting two Stories whose real widths are unknown is
 * the collision the guard exists to prevent. Across beats it reserves
 * nothing: an in-flight Story's window spans its whole implementation, so a
 * glob that reserved cross-beat would withhold every other Story for
 * minutes-to-hours — and `resolve-stories.js` substitutes the UNKNOWN
 * sentinel for any body it cannot parse, so a single malformed Story body
 * would collapse an N-Story run to fully serial.
 *
 * Adjacency is re-derived from the supplied records via the shared
 * `buildStoryAdjacency` builder (`lib/story-adjacency.js`) — the same
 * `blocked by #NNN` / `dependencies[]` source order the dispatch manifest
 * and the existing wave wrappers use — so this core never disagrees with
 * the manifest about what depends on what.

/**
 * Select the set of Stories safe to dispatch on this beat.
 *
 * Algorithm (continuous, dependency-driven — no wave barrier):
 *
 *   1. **Adjacency.** Re-derive `Map<id, depIds[]>` from the supplied
 *      records via `buildStoryAdjacency`. The `dropForeign` flag controls
 *      how a dependency on an id **outside** the supplied set is treated:
 *      - `dropForeign: false` (default, standalone-path semantics) — the
 *        foreign dependency still gates the dependent: an absent dependency
 *        is treated as not-yet-done and withholds the dependent until it
 *        completes (preserves the operator-DAG contract).
 *      - `dropForeign: true` (Epic-path semantics) — a foreign edge is
 *        pruned so the DAG stays closed over the scheduled Story set. An
 *        Epic's Stories depend only on siblings, so a `blocked by #N` whose
 *        target is out-of-scope (a foreign id, or a typo) must be dropped,
 *        not treated as a permanent unsatisfiable gate — otherwise the
 *        dependent Story is never schedulable and the run silently strands
 *        it. This matches `build-wave-dag.js`, which builds the Epic
 *        wave DAG with the same default-`dropForeign` builder.
 *   2. **Done set.** Union the caller-supplied `doneIds` with every record
 *      that classifies as `done` (live label / closed issue). A Story's
 *      dependency counts as satisfied iff it is in this union.
 *   3. **Eligibility.** A Story is *eligible* when it classifies as `ready`
 *      (not done / blocked / executing) **and** every one of its
 *      dependencies is in the done set. This is the no-false-barrier
 *      property: C depending only on A is eligible the instant A is done,
 *      even while an unrelated B is still pending.
 *   4. **Capacity.** The dispatch set never exceeds `slots = max(0,
 *      globalCap − inFlight)`. `inFlight` is the caller's count of Stories
 *      already occupying a slot (executing / closing / dispatched-not-yet-
 *      labelled). When `slots <= 0`, the result is empty.
 *   5. **Overlap guard.** Greedily admit eligible Stories in ascending-id
 *      order, skipping any whose file footprint overlaps a Story **already
 *      admitted this beat** ({@link storiesOverlap}) or shares a **concrete**
 *      path with a Story **still in flight from an earlier beat**
 *      (`inFlightRecords`, {@link reservesConcretePath}). A withheld Story
 *      stays eligible and is naturally re-considered on the next beat once
 *      the Story reserving its files has cleared.
 *
 * The result is deterministic: eligible Stories are considered in
 * ascending-id order, so the same inputs always yield the same set.
 *
 * @param {object} args
 * @param {StoryRecord[]} args.stories  Live Story records in scope.
 * @param {Array<number|string>|Set<number|string>} [args.doneIds]
 *   Ids the caller already knows are done (e.g. from a prior beat). Merged
 *   with records that classify as done.
 * @param {number} [args.inFlight=0]    Count of Stories already occupying a
 *   slot. Subtracted from `globalCap` to compute remaining capacity.
 * @param {number} args.globalCap       Hard ceiling on total concurrent
 *   Stories.
 * @param {boolean} [args.dropForeign=false] Adjacency closure policy (see
 *   step 1 above). `false` keeps a foreign dependency as a gate
 *   (standalone / operator-DAG semantics); `true` prunes foreign edges so
 *   the DAG stays closed over the scheduled set (Epic semantics).
 * @param {StoryRecord[]} [args.inFlightRecords=[]] Records for the Stories
 *   already in flight, whose **concrete** footprint paths this beat must
 *   **reserve** rather than merely count. `inFlight` is a number and can only
 *   shrink capacity; without the records a Story admitted now can share files
 *   with one dispatched on an earlier beat and still implementing — a
 *   guaranteed merge conflict at close (Story #4950). A glob / UNKNOWN
 *   footprint reserves nothing (Story #4960). Callers that hold only ids (the
 *   `--dag`/`--in-flight` flag mode) pass nothing and get the pre-#4950
 *   same-beat-only behaviour.
 * @param {'enforce'|'advisory'} [args.footprintGuard='enforce'] Whether a
 *   footprint collision **withholds** a Story (`enforce`, the default and
 *   today's behaviour) or merely **reports** one while dispatch follows the
 *   declared `depends_on` edges alone (`advisory`). Advisory never changes what
 *   the guard *detects* — every would-be withhold is still computed and
 *   returned in `footprintWithholds` with `enforced: false` — so turning it on
 *   trades serialization for throughput without going blind (Story #5044).
 * @param {string} [args.tempRoot] Resolved `project.paths.tempRoot`, threaded
 *   so the evidence scrape can ignore gitignored scratch paths.
 * @returns {{
 *   selected: StoryRecord[],

 *   `selected` is the dispatch set: a subset of `stories`, ascending by id,
 *   overlap-free, length ≤ `globalCap − inFlight`. `withheldByInFlight`
 *   names each eligible Story a reservation held back and the in-flight
 *   Story that holds it. `footprintWithholds` is the **complete** ledger —
 *   beat-local skips as well as cross-beat reservations, each with the
 *   colliding paths and its `declared-overlap` / `scraped-overlap` source — so
 *   no withheld dispatch is unexplained (Story #5044).
