/**
 * GitHub Provider — shared "link child issue to a parent" helper.
 *
 * Story #5139 — a container Epic holds its children as native GitHub
 * sub-issue edges. The read side has existed since v1
 * (`sub-issues.js` → `getNativeSubIssues`, and the three-strategy
 * aggregator in `issues.js` → `getSubTickets`); this is the missing write.
 *
 * API surface used:
 *   Read:  GET  /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/sub_issues
 *   Write: POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/sub_issues
 *          body: { "sub_issue_id": <integer db id of the CHILD issue> }
 *
 * **`sub_issue_id` is the child's database id, not its issue number.** They
 * are different integers and both are plausible, so a mix-up does not throw
 * — it silently links the wrong issue, or a nonexistent one. This mirrors
 * `blocked-by-add.js`, whose `issue_id` carries the same trap.
 *
 * Contract (deliberately identical to `blocked-by-add.js`):
 *   - **Idempotent** — reads existing edges first; only POSTs missing ones.
 *   - **Non-fatal** — catches all errors per edge, warns, and continues.
 *     The function never throws; failures are returned in the summary.
 *     The Epic body's checklist is the durable mirror, so a lost edge
 *     degrades discoverability rather than losing the child.
 *   - **No-op on empty input.**
