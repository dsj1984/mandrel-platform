/**
 * CLI: ratchet-down gate for the always-loaded documentation context budget
 * (Story #4438, Epic #4430 — Context Economy).
 *
 * Follows the standalone `check-arch-cycles.js` / `check-dead-exports.js`
 * precedent — a pure-Node, baseline-aware, sub-second checker wired into the
 * CI `baselines` job — rather than a `baselines/kinds/` metric. It measures the
 * live byte total of two documentation read-tiers and compares each against a
 * single committed budget in `baselines/context-budget.json`:
 *
 *   - `alwaysLoaded`  — the `CLAUDE.md` `@`-import closure re-paid on every
 *                       session and every subagent spawn (instructions.md § 4).
 *   - `mandatoryRead` — the resolved `project.docsContextFiles` set.
 *   - `workflow`      — the workflow **mandatory closure** (Story #4752): every
 *                       `.agents/workflows/**` entry point plus the transitive
 *                       closure of its `mandatoryReads:` frontmatter edges. The
 *                       companion **reachable** closure (per entry point) is
 *                       recorded under the top-level `workflowClosure` key as a
 *                       drift signal and never gates — growth there is a
 *                       reading-cost signal, not a contract violation.
 *
 * It additionally enforces a **per-file** ceiling on the role-scoped agent-boot
 * tier (`.agents/agents/*.md`, #4478): no single boot context may exceed
 * `agentBoot.ceilingBytes` (default 8192). This is a per-agent cap, not a sum
 * ratchet — each role def is a standalone system prompt a converted spawn boots
 * on, and adding another role def is legitimate.
 *
 * The recorded `agentBoot` rows are additionally held **in sync with the tree**
 * (Story #4830), because those rows are what an author sizes an edit against.
 * The two drift directions are deliberately asymmetric:
 *
 *   - **permissive** (the row understates the file, or no row exists) — the row
 *     promises headroom that does not exist, the gate stays green, and the
 *     shortfall only lands as a ceiling failure once the edit is written. This
 *     fails the gate.
 *   - **restrictive** (the row overstates the file) — an author under-spends
 *     and the ceiling is never surprised, so it is self-correcting. Reported as
 *     a `-` line; exit stays 0.
 *
 * Each row also records its `headroomBytes` under the ceiling, so the budget an
 * author reads is stated rather than re-derived.
 *
 * A read-tier that resolves **empty** is skipped silently (the `docsContextFiles`
 * half skips when unconfigured / its files are absent), so a repo with no
 * `CLAUDE.md` and no context docs is a clean no-op.
 *
 * Ratchet semantics (mirroring the sibling ratchets):
 *   - A gated tier grows beyond `baseline.tiers.<tier>.totalBytes +
 *     baseline.toleranceBytes` → exit 1, naming the tier and its delta.
 *   - A gated tier shrinks below its baseline total → exit 1 (Story #4872).
 *     A ratchet that only tightens in one direction lets every measured
 *     improvement evaporate: the recorded total keeps promising headroom the
 *     tree no longer spends, so the next growth is absorbed by stale slack
 *     instead of being reported. Shrinkage is therefore **actionable** —
 *     refresh the baseline down and the gain is locked in. Unlike growth this
 *     is deliberately **zero-tolerance**: `toleranceBytes` exists to keep a
 *     trivial addition from churning the file, and applying it downward would
 *     silently discard every sub-tolerance gain.
 *   - A recorded row naming a path the measured tier no longer contains →
 *     exit 1. The row describes a file that has been deleted or de-listed, so
 *     the bytes it contributes to the recorded total are fiction.
 *   - Within tolerance / clean → exit 0.
 *   - Baseline file absent → warn + exit 0 (no-op; nothing to ratchet against).
 *
 * Tolerance lives in the baseline JSON (`toleranceBytes`) — there is **no**
 * `.agentrc.json` config key; this is a framework-internal dogfooding ratchet,
 * like arch-cycles.
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --baseline <path>  override the budget path (default
 *                      `baselines/context-budget.json`, resolved from cwd).
 *   --root <path>      resolve tiers against an explicit repo root (default cwd).
 *   --update           reseed the baseline from the current measurement (keeps
 *                      the existing `toleranceBytes`, or defaults it) and exit 0.
 *   --json             write the structured envelope to stdout.
