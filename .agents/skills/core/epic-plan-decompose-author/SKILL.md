# epic-plan-decompose-author

## Policy Capsule

- Run only after `epic-plan-decompose.js --emit-context` has written `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/decomposer-context.json`; fail loudly if the file is missing.
- Emit exactly one artifact: `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json` (a JSON array). Do not write anywhere else, and never call the GitHub API from this Skill — persistence belongs to the script.
- Output is JSON only — no prose, no Markdown fence. The downstream validator (`lib/orchestration/ticket-validator.js`) is the authoritative gate; re-author rather than hand-patching when it rejects.
- Treat **`maxTickets`** from the context envelope as a **reviewability budget**, not a hard authoring cap (Story #2798). Merge narrow, single-module Stories into their capability first; if the plan genuinely needs more, emit the full plan and add a compact `over_budget_rationale` note inside the first Story's `## Goal` section explaining why the plan exceeds the budget. Operator persistence then requires the explicit `--allow-over-budget` override on `epic-plan-decompose.js`; without it the persist step rejects the over-budget array. Never truncate the JSON array to fit.
- Honour the 2-tier hierarchy: every ticket is a **Story** attached directly to the Epic. Stories carry the implementation scope inline; no Feature and no lower ticket tier exists. Thematic grouping is prose in the Epic body / Tech Spec, never a ticket.
- **Decompose at deliverable granularity, not module/task level.** A Story is a capability slice a frontier model delivers and self-verifies in one pass — a shippable slice a reviewer would accept as a single PR — not a single module or file. See the STORY SIZING section for the full guidance and the single-consumer merge rule.
- Every ticket carries `type::story` and `persona::*` labels. Every Story ticket object MUST carry top-level `acceptance: string[]` and `verify: string[]` arrays (read by `hasInlineAcceptanceAndVerify` in the validator) and `body` MUST be a **string** produced by `serialize()` from `lib/story-body/story-body.js` — an object body causes `createOp` in `epic-spec-reconciler-ops.js` to throw `StoryBodyParseError` (Story #3302), and is also silently discarded by `composeStoryBody` in the GitHub provider, producing an empty issue body.
- **New-File Contract**: any path referenced in `goal`, `acceptance`, or `verify` that does not exist on `main` MUST appear in the Story's `changes[]` with `assumption: "creates"`; otherwise the freshness validator rejects the decompose.
- Acceptance items MUST be **observable from outside the agent** (command exits 0, file exists, snapshot matches, testid resolves). Items like "verify by reading the diff" or "looks good" are forbidden — push them into `verify` commands instead.
- Acceptance MUST NOT prescribe a commit subject starting with a non-Conventional-Commits prefix; the literal `baseline-refresh:` leading token is forbidden (use a body trailer instead — see Epic #2501).
- A legitimately broad Story (files > `hardFiles`) MUST declare `wide` with a one-line reason (encoded in the serialized body string via the `<!-- meta -->` comment) to lift the `hardFiles` rejection; lead the sizing decision with cohesion, not count. UI-touching Stories MUST end `changes` with a `data-testid invariance:` or `data-testid changes: <old> -> <new>` declaration.
- A Story's `depends_on` references only **sibling Stories within the same Epic**. Apply the cross-cutting-config-file rule (sequential `depends_on` or a late-wave wiring Story) whenever multiple Stories edit a shared root config file.
- **Authoring-contract altitude (Epic #4131 F8).** `acceptance[]` and `verify[]` are the Story's **binding contract** — the executor MUST satisfy them exactly, and they are the only definition of "done." `changes[]` and `references[]` are an **advisory implementation sketch**: a best-effort prediction of which files the work touches that the executor MAY revise when the codebase tells a different story. Author `acceptance[]`/`verify[]` so they capture the outcome independently of any particular file layout — never bake an incidental implementation detail into them that the advisory sketch is free to change. This does **not** weaken the file-assumption gate: `changes[]` paths are still validated structurally against the base branch (a `creates` against an existing path still fails), the New-File Contract still holds, and the executor's revised approach stays bounded by the inviolable `acceptance[]`/`verify[]` contract and `rules/security-baseline.md`.
- **Navigate-don't-deep-link acceptance standard (Epic #4131 F5).** For any Story whose acceptance describes a **signed-in** (authenticated) scenario reaching a feature surface, author the acceptance so the persona starts from their authenticated home and **reaches the feature through navigation** (clicking a nav door, menu item, or link the UI exposes) — never by asserting against a hardcoded deep-link URL. A scenario that drops the user straight onto `/some/feature/path` proves the page renders but not that the feature is reachable, masking orphaned surfaces with no nav owner. Phrase signed-in acceptance as "from the signed-in home, the persona navigates to … and sees …", not "loading `/feature/path` shows the feature."

## Role

Senior Project Manager + Orchestrator. The Skill's job is to take a PRD plus
a Tech Spec and emit a flat Story backlog the orchestrator can execute
autonomously.

## When to use

`/plan` Phase 8, immediately after
`epic-plan-decompose.js --emit-context` writes
`temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/decomposer-context.json`. The Skill replaces the
inline "Author the Ticket Array" step in the legacy workflow body —
the caller dispatches this Skill via the `Skill` tool, supplies the Epic
ID, and on completion has `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json` ready for
the persist + validate half of the script.

## Inputs

The dispatcher passes the Epic ID as the Skill argument. The Skill itself
reads:

- `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/decomposer-context.json` — produced by
  `node .agents/scripts/epic-plan-decompose.js --epic <Epic_ID> --emit-context`.
  Fields:
  - `epic.id`, `epic.title`
  - `prd.body` (or `prd.bodySummary` when downgraded by the
    planning-context budget) — required for User-Story extraction
  - `techSpec.body` (or `techSpec.bodySummary`) — required for module
    boundary + dependency-DAG extraction
  - `heuristics[]` — risk heuristics surfaced from
    `agentSettings.planning.riskHeuristics`. Apply each one against the
    Stories you are emitting; flag matches via `risk::high` labels.
  - `maxTickets` — reviewability budget; a framework constant
    (`LIMITS_DEFAULTS.maxTickets` in `.agents/scripts/lib/config/limits.js`,
    not operator-configurable — Story #2798, Story #4163). Default: stay
    under. When the plan genuinely needs more, emit the full plan with
    an `over_budget_rationale` and rely on the operator's
    `--allow-over-budget` override at persist time. The script logs the
    resolved value to stderr.
  - `contextMode` — `"full"` or `"summary"`. When `"summary"`, work
    from the `bodySummary` fields rather than re-fetching the bodies.

  - `systemPrompt` — the **authoritative, fully-rendered decomposer system
    prompt** (Story #4162). It is produced by `renderDecomposerSystemPrompt`
    in
    [`decomposer-prompts.js`](../../../scripts/lib/templates/decomposer-prompts.js),
    the single source of the prompt body, with `maxTickets`,
    `maxTokenBudget`, and the sizing thresholds already interpolated. Apply
    **this** string as your system prompt — this SKILL deliberately does NOT
    embed a second verbatim copy of the prompt body, so the two surfaces
    cannot drift. The sections below are authoring guidance that complements
    the rendered prompt; they are not a replacement copy of it.

## Outputs

- `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json` — JSON array of Story
  objects conforming to the schema in this Skill's body.

The file MUST exist before the Skill returns. The caller will then run
`node .agents/scripts/epic-plan-decompose.js --epic <Epic_ID> --tickets
temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json`, which validates the array, persists
the hierarchy as GitHub issues, and transitions the Epic to
`agent::ready`. The script's validator is the final gate — author for
its rules, not for "looks right."

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Load the context

Read `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/decomposer-context.json` with the `Read` tool.
Pin three values explicitly before writing any tickets:

1. `maxTickets` — your reviewability budget. Merge narrow slices into
   capability Stories rather than spilling over the budget; if the plan
   genuinely needs more, emit the full plan with an
   `over_budget_rationale` (Story #2798).
2. `contextMode` — if `"summary"`, the body strings are bounded; trust
   them, but keep Tasks more conservative because the upstream context
   is partial.
3. `heuristics[]` — render the active risk heuristics in front of you
   so the planning persona can mention them as Stories are emitted.

### Step 2 — Decompose against the rendered system prompt

Apply the fully-rendered decomposer system prompt — the `systemPrompt`
field of the loaded context envelope, produced by
[`decomposer-prompts.js`](../../../scripts/lib/templates/decomposer-prompts.js)
— to the PRD + Tech Spec bodies. That rendered string is the authoritative
prompt body (with `maxTickets`, `maxTokenBudget`, and the sizing thresholds
already interpolated); the authoring-guidance sections below complement it
without restating it. Emit JSON only (no prose, no Markdown fence). The
downstream validator in
[`lib/orchestration/ticket-validator.js`](../../../scripts/lib/orchestration/ticket-validator.js)
will reject anything off-shape. Merge narrow, single-module slices into
their capability first; emit one Story per capability slice a frontier
model can deliver and self-verify in one pass.

### Step 3 — Write the file

Write the final JSON array to `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json` with
the `Write` tool. Do not pretty-print past 2-space indent — the file is
machine-consumed.

### Step 4 — Hand back to `/plan`

Return control. The caller invokes
`node .agents/scripts/epic-plan-decompose.js --epic <Epic_ID> --tickets
temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json`, which validates, persists, and flips
the Epic to `agent::ready`.

## Decomposer system prompt — single-sourced (Story #4162)

The authoritative decomposer system-prompt **body** is single-sourced in
[`decomposer-prompts.js`](../../../scripts/lib/templates/decomposer-prompts.js)
(`renderDecomposerSystemPrompt`) and delivered to you fully rendered in the
`systemPrompt` field of `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/decomposer-context.json` — with
`maxTickets`, `maxTokenBudget`, the `DEFAULT_TASK_SIZING` thresholds, and the
risk heuristics already interpolated. **Apply that rendered string as your
system prompt.** This SKILL deliberately does **not** embed a second verbatim
copy of the prompt body (the preamble, the JSON output schema, the hierarchy /
label / output-format rules); duplicating it here is exactly the drift the
single-source contract exists to prevent, and the guard test in
`tests/ticket-decomposer.test.js` fails if a second full copy reappears on
either surface.

The value `${maxTickets}` in the rendered prompt is substituted at runtime
from the `maxTickets` field of the loaded context. Treat it as the
**reviewability budget** (Story #2798) — stay under by default; over-budget
plans need an `over_budget_rationale` plus operator `--allow-over-budget` to
persist. It is **not** a hard authoring cap: the prompt no longer carries any
ticket-count limit directive, and you MUST never truncate the JSON array to fit
(Story #4162). The rendered prompt also names the delivery token
budget (`maxTokenBudget`) as the real one-pass sizing envelope — size each
Story so a single agent can deliver and self-verify it within that budget.

## Authoring guidance (complements the rendered prompt)

The sections below are the SKILL's authoring guidance. They do **not** restate
the rendered prompt body — they record the contract details and sizing
heuristics you apply when shaping the ticket array. Where a number appears it
is the `DEFAULT_TASK_SIZING` default; the rendered prompt interpolates the live
value, which always wins.

### STORY BODY SHAPE (string body, top-level acceptance/verify)

For Stories, `body` MUST be a **string** — the serialized markdown produced by
calling `serialize()` from `lib/story-body/story-body.js`. Do NOT emit `body`
as a JSON object: `createOp` in `epic-spec-reconciler-ops.js` will throw
`StoryBodyParseError` when it receives an object body (Story #3302
serialize-or-throw contract), and `composeStoryBody` in the GitHub provider
also discards non-string bodies producing an empty issue. The freshness gate
(`collectTaskChangesPaths`) and the assumption gate
(`collectStoryAssumptionEntries`) both parse the string body via
`story-body.js#parse` to recover `changes[]`/`references[]` — they operate
correctly only on the serialized string form.

The `acceptance[]` and `verify[]` arrays live at the **top level** of the
Story ticket object (not nested inside `body`). The validator's
`hasInlineAcceptanceAndVerify(story)` reads `story.acceptance` and
`story.verify` directly — nesting them inside a body object makes them
invisible to the validator, causing the backlog to be treated as the legacy
4-tier shape and producing a `Cross-Validation Failed: Backlog must contain at
least one Task.` error.

The serialized `body` string renders these markdown sections in order: `##
Goal` (one sentence), `## Changes` (object-form `{ "path", "assumption" }`
bullets), `## Acceptance` (checkbox items), `## Verify` (command + tier), and
`## References` (read-only `{ "path", "assumption": "exists" }` bullets).
Fields `wide` and `estimated_test_files` are encoded as a `<!-- meta: {...}
-->` comment appended to the serialized body string (handled by `serialize()`).
They are NOT top-level ticket fields.

#### STORY BODY RULES

- **slug**: MUST be hyphen-case (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`). Do not use underscores.
- **goal** (in body string): One sentence stating WHY this Story exists within the Epic.
- **reason_to_exist** (REQUIRED, encoded in the body `<!-- meta: {...} -->` comment — NOT a top-level ticket field): One sentence stating the single coherent reason this Story exists, distinct from the broader `goal` prose. Every Story MUST carry a non-empty `reason_to_exist`; it is the machine-checkable form of the cohesion rule (**one Story = one coherent change with one reason to exist**). The `epic-plan-consolidate` critic flags any Story whose body carries no non-empty reason, and the sizing validator (`ticket-validator-sizing.js`) emits a deterministic **soft** `missing-reason-to-exist` finding as the runtime backstop. Encode it as `<!-- meta: {"reason_to_exist": "..."} -->`.
- **changes** (in body string): Each entry is an object `{ path, assumption }` where `assumption` is one of `creates | refactors-existing | deletes`. The Phase 8 validator probes the base branch for every declared path and rejects the decompose when the declared assumption contradicts reality: `creates` against an existing path is an error, `refactors-existing` / `deletes` against a missing path is an error. Use `refactors-existing` for in-place edits to a file already on `main`; `creates` for net-new files; `deletes` for removals. Acceptable path shapes include explicit files (`src/components/Foo.tsx`), glob patterns (`tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`, `**/*.astro`), and module identifiers that resolve to files.
- **references** (in body string, optional): Object-form entries `{ path, assumption: "exists" }` for paths the Story **reads** but does not modify (test fixtures it relies on, sibling modules it imports, feature files it scans). The validator probes these like `changes` and rejects the decompose when an `exists` path is absent on the base branch. Use this list to make read-dependencies explicit so a hallucinated or stale assumption surfaces at planning time rather than execution time.
- **NEW-FILE CONTRACT (must-follow)**: Any path the Story references in `goal`, `acceptance`, or `verify` that does **not** already exist on `main` MUST also appear in the same Story's `changes` array with `assumption: "creates"`. The freshness validator probes `main` for every referenced code path and rejects the decompose when a missing path is absent from `changes` — even when the Story is the one authoring the file. Example: a Story creating `tests/lib/foo.test.js` whose `verify` runs `node --test tests/lib/foo.test.js` MUST include `{ "path": "tests/lib/foo.test.js", "assumption": "creates" }` in `changes`, otherwise the validator emits a freshness miss and the decompose round trips for a re-emit.
- **acceptance** (top-level array on ticket object): Items MUST be observable from outside the agent. Acceptable shapes: a specific command exits 0, a file exists at a given path, a snapshot test matches, a `data-testid` resolves under a given selector, a row count in a fixture matches. UNACCEPTABLE: "verify by reading the diff", "looks good", "matches the spec" — push these down into a `verify` command instead.
- **verify** (top-level array on ticket object): Each entry MUST name a testing tier in parentheses, drawn from `unit` / `contract` / `e2e` / `validate`. Example: `npm run test -- src/x.test.ts (unit)`, `npm run validate (validate)`. Stories with zero verify entries SHOULD fail validation; if a Story is genuinely unverifiable in isolation (e.g., a copy edit auditor will eyeball), the literal entry `manual:<reason>` is allowed so the absence is intentional, not lazy. Manual entries without a reason are rejected.
- **estimated_test_files** (optional, encoded in body meta comment): Integer estimate of how many test files this Story creates or modifies. Omit when the number is not estimable. Informational only — it does not gate the decompose.

#### FORBIDDEN SUBJECT-PREFIX PRESCRIPTIONS (Conventional-Commits only)

- `acceptance` items MUST NOT prescribe a commit subject that begins with a non-Conventional-Commits prefix. The allowed leading types are `feat|fix|chore|refactor|perf|docs|style|test|build|ci|revert` (matching `commitlint.config.js` and `release-please-config.json`). Historic ad-hoc subject prefixes — such as the legacy `baseline-refresh` token used as a leading prefix — are FORBIDDEN as subject prescriptions, because they fail the local `commit-msg` hook and the close-time validator (`ticket-validator.js` → `validateAcceptanceSubjectPrefix`) will reject the decompose with `code: 'forbidden-subject-prefix'`. When a Story needs a baseline-refresh-style classification, prescribe a Conventional-Commits subject (e.g. `chore(baselines): refresh maintainability snapshot`) and, if a machine-readable marker is required, prescribe a body trailer such as `baseline-refresh: true` (note the trailing space and value, not a subject prefix). See Epic #2501 for the rationale.

#### STORY SIZING — DELIVERABLE GRANULARITY, COHESION FIRST (the numeric ceiling is only a backstop)

**Decompose at deliverable granularity, not module/task level.** A Story is a **capability slice a frontier model delivers and self-verifies in one pass** — a shippable slice a reviewer would accept as a single PR, a capability or user-visible surface, **not a single module or file**. Fold module-level slices into the capability they belong to rather than emitting one Story per module. (This definition is the single source of truth in `DELIVERABLE_GRANULARITY_GUIDANCE` in `ticket-validator-sizing.js`; the rendered decomposer prompt interpolates the same string — do not restate a divergent version here.)

The first question is **cohesion, not count**: *is this one coherent change with one reason to exist?* File count cannot tell a trivial 10-file mechanical rename from a hard 3-file parser+caller+config change — so lead with the change's reason, not its size. Size against the real one-pass delivery envelope (`maxTokenBudget`): a Story is correctly sized when a single agent can hold its full change, acceptance, and verification in one pass within that budget.

- **One Story = one coherent change with one reason to exist.** If you cannot state that reason in a sentence, the Story is probably two Stories.
- **Single-consumer merge rule.** A Story whose only consumer is one sibling Story should be **merged into that sibling** rather than emitted separately — a single-consumer downstream slice is not its own unit of work.
- **Split independent, parallelizable work** into sibling Stories — but only when the pieces genuinely have separate reasons to exist.
- **Declare `wide` with a one-line reason when a change is legitimately broad** (a cohesive cutover that spans many files for one reason).

**Numeric backstop.** The thresholds are defined **once**, in the `DEFAULT_TASK_SIZING` constant in `ticket-validator-sizing.js` (operator-overridable via `agentSettings.planning.taskSizing`). They are a backstop, not the primary rule — do not restate divergent numbers anywhere else. The defaults:

- A Story touching more than **`softFiles` (15)** files emits an advisory width finding — a nudge to check cohesion or declare `wide`.
- A Story touching more than **`hardFiles` (30)** files is **rejected** unless it declares `wide` with a reason.
- A Story with more than **`maxAcceptance` (14)** acceptance items is **rejected**; more than **`softAcceptanceCount` (10)** emits an advisory warning.

#### DELIVERY SLICING (consume the Tech Spec target grouping when present)

The Tech Spec may carry a `## Delivery Slicing` section authored by the
Architect, proposing how the PRD's enumerated capabilities cluster into N
shippable Stories. When that section is **present**, treat it as the **target
grouping**: prefer emitting Stories that match the Architect's proposed
clusters rather than mapping PRD capabilities 1:1. When it is **absent**,
degrade gracefully — decompose at deliverable granularity using the cohesion
rules above, exactly as before. The Phase 8 holistic consolidation pass
(`epic-plan-consolidate`) reconciles your draft against this same Delivery
Slicing target before persist, so aligning to it here reduces the work the
consolidation critic has to do.

#### `wide` DECLARATION (optional — for legitimately broad changes)

A Story whose footprint is legitimately broad declares `wide` carrying a one-line human-readable reason. Encode it in the `<!-- meta: {"wide": {"reason": "..."}} -->` comment that `serialize()` appends to the body string — e.g. `"wide": { "reason": "hard contract cutover: migrate every <X> call site in one PR" }`.

Declaring `wide` with a non-empty reason **lifts the `hardFiles` rejection** — no Story is rejected for width when it states why it is broad. Omit `wide` for ordinary Stories; a wide footprint with no `wide` declaration emits only an advisory nudge (check cohesion or declare `wide`), never a rejection on its own. Glob entries in `changes[]` (bullets containing `*`) are `unknown-width`: the numeric ceiling is skipped, and a glob Story with no `wide` declaration emits the same advisory nudge.

#### UI / TESTID INVARIANCE (per CLAUDE.md safety rule)

- Stories that touch UI (`*.tsx`, `*.astro`, `*.svelte`, `*.vue`, components folders) MUST end `changes` with one of:
  - `data-testid invariance: <list of testids that MUST be preserved>`, or
  - `data-testid changes: <old> -> <new>` paired with a corresponding `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts` edit in the same Story or a depends_on Story.
- Renaming a testid without the matching e2e edit is FORBIDDEN.

#### BRAND / COPY / STYLE WORK

- Stories that touch user-visible copy, brand assets, or visual style MUST cite the relevant section of `docs/style-guide.md` in `acceptance` (e.g. `"acceptance": ["Hero copy matches docs/style-guide.md §3 (voice & tone)"]`). If `docs/style-guide.md` does not exist or has no relevant section, state that explicitly: `"acceptance": ["docs/style-guide.md absent — copy reviewed against the inline brand brief in PRD §2"]`. Silence on style sourcing is a smell.

#### BINDING ACCEPTANCE vs ADVISORY CHANGES (authoring altitude)

The canonical altitude + New-File Contract wording is single-sourced in `AUTHORING_ALTITUDE_GUIDANCE` in `ticket-validator-sizing.js` (Story #4272); the rendered decomposer prompt interpolates the same strings, so do not restate a divergent version here. The three canonical statements:

- **Binding contract vs advisory sketch.** `acceptance[]` and `verify[]` are the Story's **binding contract** — the executor MUST satisfy them exactly, and they are the only definition of "done." `changes[]` and `references[]` are an **advisory implementation sketch**: your best prediction of the file footprint, which the executor MAY revise when the real codebase diverges from the sketch. Author `acceptance[]` / `verify[]` to assert the **outcome** independent of any one file layout — never pin an incidental implementation detail (an internal helper name, a private file path) into an acceptance item that the advisory `changes[]` is free to reshape; assert the observable behaviour instead.
- **New-File Contract.** Any path named in a Story's `goal`, `acceptance`, or `verify` that does NOT already exist on `main` MUST also appear in that Story's `changes[]` with `assumption: "creates"`; otherwise the freshness validator rejects the decompose — even when the Story is the one authoring the file.
- **Advisory does not mean unvalidated.** `changes[]` paths still pass the base-branch file-assumption probes (a `creates` against an existing path still fails), the New-File Contract still holds, and the executor's latitude to revise the approach never licenses skipping `acceptance[]` / `verify[]` or relaxing any `rules/security-baseline.md` MUST.

#### NAVIGATE-DON'T-DEEP-LINK (signed-in acceptance scenarios)

When a Story's acceptance describes a **signed-in / authenticated** persona reaching a feature surface, author it so the persona starts from their authenticated home and **reaches the feature through navigation** — clicking a nav door, menu entry, or link the UI actually exposes — **never** via a hardcoded deep-link URL.

- A deep-link scenario (`load /reports/export and assert the export button`) proves the page renders but NOT that it is reachable; it masks an orphaned surface that no navigation door points to.
- Phrase it as: `"From the signed-in home, the persona navigates to Reports → Export and sees the export button"` — not `"GET /reports/export returns the export view"`.
- This applies to signed-in journeys only; an unauthenticated landing page or a deliberately deep-linkable share URL is exempt — say so in the acceptance item when you take that exemption.

### WAVE-0 BDD SCAFFOLD STORY (features-first; emit when the Acceptance Spec has `new`-disposition rows)

The Acceptance Spec's AC table (columns `AC ID | Outcome | Feature File | Scenario | Disposition`) tags each row's `Disposition` with one of `new | updated | unchanged`. A `new` row names a `.feature` file + scenario that does NOT yet exist on `main`. The framework is features-first: implementation Stories reference those `.feature` paths in their `verify[]` lines, so the files MUST already exist when those Stories run — otherwise verification fails mid-delivery on a missing file (observed gap: Epic #18 in `dsj1984/athportal` had 9 `new` rows and no Story tasked with creating the feature files Stories #1457 / #1466 verified against).

When the Acceptance Spec contains **one or more `Disposition: new` rows**, you MUST emit **exactly one** dedicated wave-0 scaffold Story whose sole job is to create those `.feature` files with `@skip`-tagged scenarios BEFORE any implementation Story runs:

- **goal** (in body string): contains the literal token `bdd-scaffold`.
- **depends_on**: EMPTY (`[]`) — the scaffold runs first, in wave 0.
- **changes** (in body string): one `{ path, assumption: "creates" }` entry per distinct `.feature` file named in a `new` row.
- **acceptance** (top-level array): MUST assert (a) every new `.feature` file exists, (b) every new scenario within them carries an `@skip` tag, AND (c) every new scenario also carries its **namespaced per-Epic AC tag** `@epic-<id>-ac-N` (one tag per AC ID the scenario satisfies). Keep items observable (a command exits 0; a file exists at a path).
- **The namespaced AC tag is REQUIRED at scaffold time, not only at de-skip time.** Phase 7 finalize's `acceptance-spec-reconciler.js` matches AC IDs only against `@epic-<id>-ac-*` / `@pending` tags under `tests/features/**` — a bare `@ac-N` tag is deliberately ignored to prevent cross-Epic collision (Story #3362). A scaffolded scenario carrying `@skip` but no `@epic-<id>-ac-N` tag reads as `missing[]` at finalize and throws, aborting close, even after the implementation Story de-skips it — the tag was never added in either pass. Tag each scenario with both `@skip` AND `@epic-<id>-ac-N` (substituting the Epic's real ID and the scenario's own AC number) in this SAME wave-0 commit; do not defer the AC tag to the later de-skip edit.
- **verify** (top-level array): a grep/validate command (tier `validate`), NOT an e2e runner — verifying that a file exists with the required tags needs no browser/playwright run. Include a check that each new AC ID's namespaced tag is present in the scaffolded files, alongside the `@skip` check.
- Each implementation Story whose `verify[]` references a scaffolded `.feature` path MUST add `depends_on: ["<scaffold-slug>"]` so the scaffold lands in an earlier wave. Omitting the link trips the soft `missing-bdd-scaffold` finding in `ticket-validator-conflicts.js` (advisory, not a hard block).

When the Acceptance Spec contains **zero `new`-disposition rows** (every row is `updated` or `unchanged`), do NOT emit a scaffold Story — there is nothing to create.

**Worked example.** Epic #42, Acceptance Spec with two `new` rows (`AC-1` -> `tests/features/billing/invoice.feature`, `AC-2` -> `tests/features/billing/refund.feature`). The scaffold Story below uses a serialized string `body`, top-level `acceptance`/`verify` arrays, an empty `depends_on`, and tags each scenario with both `@skip` and its namespaced `@epic-42-ac-N` tag:

    {
      "slug": "scaffold-billing-feature-files",
      "type": "story",
      "title": "Scaffold @skip-tagged billing feature files",
      "depends_on": [],
      "labels": ["type::story", "persona::qa-engineer"],
      "acceptance": [
        "tests/features/billing/invoice.feature and tests/features/billing/refund.feature both exist on the branch",
        "every Scenario in the two new feature files is preceded by an @skip tag (grep for un-skipped scenarios returns zero matches)",
        "the invoice.feature scenario carries @epic-42-ac-1 and the refund.feature scenario carries @epic-42-ac-2"

    }

The implementation Stories that later un-skip and flesh out these scenarios each carry `depends_on: ["scaffold-billing-feature-files"]`, placing them in a later wave than the scaffold. They MUST NOT add the `@epic-42-ac-N` tag themselves — it is already present from the scaffold pass; their job is to remove `@skip` once the scenario passes.

### SCOPE-OVERLAP FLAGGING (docs/runbook downstream of config work)

When a "docs update" / "runbook" / "README" Story appears downstream of an earlier Story in the same Epic whose AC already covers updating the same document (e.g. a "config + runbook" Story followed by a "docs" Story touching the same runbook), the downstream Story's deliverable may be fully absorbed by the earlier Story. Flag the risk directly in the Story `body.acceptance` by appending an item of the form:
"Scope verification note: this Story's deliverable may already be satisfied by Story #<slug-or-id>'s AC — before implementing, `git diff main -- <path>` against the upstream Story branch and confirm whether a substantive edit is still required, or whether only a cross-reference remains."
This prevents the executing agent from redoing work the upstream Story already merged.

### CROSS-CUTTING CONFIG FILE EDITS (shared root files across Stories)

If two or more Stories in the same decomposition edit any of the shared
configuration files enumerated below, you MUST either:

1. Add explicit `depends_on` links chaining the affected Stories so they
   merge sequentially (preferred when the Stories share thematic scope and
   the second Story's edits build on the first), OR
2. Split the cross-cutting edits into a single dedicated late-wave "wiring"
   Story that runs after the dependents land (preferred when the dependent
   Stories are otherwise unrelated and would only collide at the wiring
   point).

Trade-offs: option (1) keeps each Story end-to-end coherent but serializes
their delivery; option (2) keeps the dependents parallel but introduces a
narrow extra Story whose AC is purely integration. Pick (1) when the shared
file edit is small and thematically owned by one of the Stories; pick (2)
when several otherwise-independent Stories all need to register themselves
in the same manifest.

Shared configuration files (non-exhaustive):

- `.github/workflows/*.yml` — any single workflow file edited by multiple
  Stories
- `package.json` at the repo root (dependency or script edits)
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `nx.json`, `lerna.json` — monorepo
  manifests
- `tsconfig.base.json`, `tsconfig.json` at the repo root
- `.gitignore`, `.npmrc`, `.nvmrc` at the repo root
- Any single file under a `schemas/` directory if it is the only producer
  of a contract consumed by other Stories — those consumers MUST
  `depends_on` the producer
- **Registry / barrel files** (Story #2962). Files whose primary purpose
  is to wire siblings together (listener registries, handler maps,
  manifest barrels) collide whenever two concurrent Stories *create new
  files* that the registry must import. The validator recognises this
  class via `planning.crossCuttingRegistries` (extender-shaped). The
  framework default list is:
  - `lib/orchestration/lifecycle/listeners/index.js`
  - `**/listeners/index.js`
  - `**/handlers/index.js`

  Trigger: two or more concurrent Stories either edit a registry path
  directly **or** declare `assumption: creates` for a file in the
  registry's parent directory. Remediation is the same as the shared
  configuration files above — sequential `depends_on` between the
  Stories, or a dedicated late-wave wiring Story. Consumers extend the
  list per-project via `planning.crossCuttingRegistries` in
  `.agentrc.json` (accepts `["…"]` to replace or `{ append: [...] }` to
  add to the framework default).

### WIDELY-USED SYMBOL DELETION (Story #2962)

When a Story's `body.changes` declares `{ path, assumption: "deletes" }`,
the decomposer probes the base branch at plan time via `git grep -l`
for files that reference the deleted module's basename. When the count
exceeds `planning.largeFanOutThreshold` (default `10`), the validator
emits a `fan-out-warning` finding and `epic-plan-decompose` refuses to
persist unless the operator passes `--allow-large-fan-out`.

This gate exists because re-prompting the planner cannot reduce a
deletion's call-site count — the only safe remediations are to split
the deletion into a subsystem-by-subsystem migration across multiple
Stories or to confirm the deletion is intentional and bypass the gate
with the flag. The threshold is configurable per-project via
`planning.largeFanOutThreshold` in `.agentrc.json`.

Do NOT silently allow two Stories to write the same root configuration
file in the same wave; parallel dispatch would produce a merge conflict
on every Story-to-Epic close after the first.

CRITICAL: Dependencies should follow execution blockers. Stories attach
directly to the Epic — never emit a `parent_slug` field. A Story's
`depends_on` MUST only reference other Stories within the SAME Epic; express
any logical ordering requirement via Story-level `depends_on`.

## Constraints

- Do **not** call the GitHub API from this Skill. Persistence is the
  script's job; the Skill is pure JSON authoring.
- Do **not** write outside `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/`. Reads may cover the
  PRD/Tech Spec bodies plus any docs the context envelope cites.
- The decomposer prompt's `${maxTickets}` value is the **reviewability
  budget** (Story #2798). Staying under is the default; exceeding it
  requires both an `over_budget_rationale` in the JSON output and the
  operator's `--allow-over-budget` flag at persist time. Silently
  exceeding the budget — or truncating the plan to fit — is forbidden.
- If `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/decomposer-context.json` is missing, fail
  loudly. Instruct the caller to run `--emit-context` first.
- The validator
  ([`lib/orchestration/ticket-validator.js`](../../../scripts/lib/orchestration/ticket-validator.js))
  is the authoritative gate. Re-author when it rejects rather than
  patching tickets by hand.
