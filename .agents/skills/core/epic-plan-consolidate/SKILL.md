# epic-plan-consolidate

## Policy Capsule

- Run only after `epic-plan-decompose-author` has written `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json`; fail loudly if the draft array is missing. Read the sectioned Epic body (which carries the folded Tech Spec sections) from `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/decomposer-context.json` (the same envelope the author skill consumed) — never re-fetch from GitHub, and never call the GitHub API from this Skill.
- Emit exactly two artifacts inside `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/`: the **consolidated** `tickets.json` (overwriting the draft array in place) and a human-readable `consolidation-report.md` (the rationale + before/after diff the operator reviews at the HITL gate). Both MUST exist before returning.
- **Scope conservation is the load-bearing invariant.** You are a *critic*, not a second author: you MUST NOT add scope, invent tickets, or drop acceptance criteria. Every acceptance item and every `verify` entry present in the draft MUST survive into the consolidated array (possibly re-homed onto a merged Story). **This is your contract, not a machine guarantee:** there is **no runtime acceptance-union diff** on your output. The only deterministic runtime backstop the validator applies after you run is the standard ticket-structure validation — it does not re-derive the pre-consolidation acceptance/verify union, so a critic that silently dropped an acceptance item would **not** be caught downstream. (The repo's unit test exercises a *pure model* of the merge over an over-fragmented fixture to document the intended invariant; it does not inspect this Skill's actual output.) Conserve scope yourself, deliberately, on every merge.
- Your operations are constrained to exactly two shapes: **(1) merge two or more Stories** into one (union their `changes`/`acceptance`/`verify`/`references`, keep one coherent `goal`); **(2) rewire `depends_on`** so the edges still reference surviving sibling-Story slugs. No other mutation is permitted.
- Consume the Tech Spec **"Delivery Slicing"** section as a **ceiling, not a target**, when one is present: the Architect's proposed N shippable Stories is an *upper bound*, not a floor. Cluster the draft's Stories toward that grouping, and go **below** N when slices form dependent single-consumer chains — a slice whose "Independent? No" row carries no justification (parallelism, risk isolation, or delivery-envelope pressure) folds into its consumer. You **never** split above N. When the section is **absent**, degrade gracefully — apply only the cohesion rules below and leave the rest of the draft shape intact.
- Apply the same cohesion heuristic the author skill leads with: **one Story = one coherent change with one reason to exist**, and the **single-consumer merge rule** (a Story whose only consumer is one sibling Story is merged into that sibling). Lead every merge decision with the change's reason, not its file count.
- **Missing reason-to-exist check (cohesion gate).** Every draft Story body MUST carry a non-empty `reason_to_exist` meta field (the parseable form of "one Story = one coherent change with one reason to exist", encoded in the `<!-- meta: {"reason_to_exist": "..."} -->` comment and surfaced as `body.reason_to_exist` by `lib/story-body/story-body.js`). Flag any Story whose body carries **no** non-empty reason to exist: a Story that cannot state its single reason in one sentence is a cohesion smell — it is probably two Stories, or two Stories that should be merged into one. Name each flagged Story in the consolidation report so the operator sees the cohesion gap at the HITL diff gate.
- After every merge, **rewire `depends_on`**: drop self-edges, collapse edges that now point at the absorbing Story onto itself, and re-point any edge that named a now-deleted slug at its surviving successor. Never leave a `depends_on` referencing a slug absent from the consolidated array — the validator HARD-rejects unknown deps.
- The consolidation report MUST name each operation applied (merged slugs → surviving slug, rewired edges) with a one-line reason, plus a before/after Story-count line, so the operator can approve or reject at the HITL diff gate before the persist call. When the consolidated count drops **below** the Delivery-Slicing count (a below-ceiling coarsening), the report MUST surface that fact explicitly — e.g. `Below ceiling: N (Delivery Slicing) → M (consolidated)` — and attach a one-line rationale to each below-ceiling merge (which dependent single-consumer slice folded into which consumer, and why it was unjustified), so the operator sees the coarsening at the Phase 8.3 advisory diff.

## Role

Senior Project Manager + Orchestrator, acting as a **holistic critic** with
fresh context — deliberately *separate* from `epic-plan-decompose-author` (the
generator) so the pass is a fresh-context review, not a same-pass self-critique.

> **Read [`examples.md`](./examples.md) on demand** for the extended rationale:
> why this critic runs with fresh context, why scope conservation is your
> contract rather than a runtime guarantee, and how the below-ceiling
> coarsening case is reported.

## When to use

`/plan` Phase 8, as the **8.3 — Holistic Consolidation** sub-step:
immediately after `epic-plan-decompose-author` writes
`temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json` and **before**
`epic-plan-decompose.js --tickets …` validates and persists. The pass operates
on the temp artifact so the holistic adjustment happens before the GitHub
write; the deterministic validator runs *after* it, so the critic can never
emit a plan the validator would reject.

## Inputs

The dispatcher passes the Epic ID as the Skill argument. The Skill itself
reads:

- `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json` — the **draft** Story array the
  `epic-plan-decompose-author` Skill wrote. This is the consolidation input.
- `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/decomposer-context.json` — the authoring envelope
  emitted by `epic-plan-decompose.js --emit-context`. Read `epicBody`
  from it — the sectioned Epic body carrying the folded Tech Spec
  sections (there is no separate `techSpec` key — Story #4324). The
  **"Delivery Slicing"**
  section (authored by `epic-plan-spec-author`) is the
  grouping **ceiling** when present (you may merge below it, never split above
  it); degrade gracefully when it is absent.

## Outputs

- `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json` — the **consolidated** array, overwriting
  the draft. Same schema as the author skill emits (flat Story array; Stories
  carry top-level `acceptance[]` / `verify[]`; `body` is a serialized string).
  The downstream `epic-plan-decompose.js --tickets …` validator is the final
  gate — author for its rules, not for "looks right."
- `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/consolidation-report.md` — a human-readable
  rationale + before/after diff. This is the artifact the workflow shows the
  operator at the HITL diff gate before the persist call.

Both files MUST exist before the Skill returns.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Load the draft and the ceiling

Read `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json` (the draft array) and
`temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/decomposer-context.json` (for the `epicBody`, which
carries the Tech Spec sections). Locate
the **"Delivery Slicing"** section. Pin two facts before mutating
anything:

1. The **grouping ceiling** — the N shippable Stories the Architect proposed in
   Delivery Slicing, or `null` when the section is absent (graceful-degrade
   mode: cohesion rules only). Treat N as an upper bound you may go below, not a
   floor you must hit. Note which slices are marked "Independent? No" and
   whether each carries a justification (parallelism, risk isolation, or
   delivery-envelope pressure) — an unjustified dependent slice is a
   fold-into-consumer candidate.
2. The **draft Story count** — so you can spot over-fragmented capability
   clusters.

### Step 2 — Plan the consolidation

Across the draft Story array, decide which Stories merge:

- **Over-fragmented capability** → when several draft Stories map to one
  Delivery-Slicing slice (or one coherent reason to exist), merge them into a
  single Story: union their `changes` / `acceptance` / `verify` / `references`,
  write one coherent `goal`, and keep the union of labels.
- **Single-consumer Story** → merge into the one sibling that consumes it. This
  is the primary lever for going **below** the Delivery-Slicing ceiling: an
  "Independent? No" slice whose only consumer is one sibling folds into that
  sibling unless its row justifies staying separate (parallelism, risk
  isolation, or delivery-envelope pressure). Coarsening below N here is
  expected, not an over-reach — record it as a below-ceiling merge (see Step 4).
- **Missing reason to exist** → flag any Story whose body carries no non-empty
  `reason_to_exist` meta field. A Story that cannot name its single coherent
  reason is a cohesion smell; record it in the report so the operator can
  re-scope it (merge, split, or have the author supply the reason) at the HITL
  gate.

Never split a draft Story to *reach* N — N is a ceiling, and adding scope is
out of contract. Record each decision with its one-line reason for the report.

### Step 3 — Rewire dependencies and conserve scope

After applying the operations:

- **Rewire `depends_on`**: drop self-edges, re-point any edge that named a
  deleted slug at its surviving successor, and dedupe. No `depends_on` may
  reference a slug absent from the consolidated array.
- **Conserve scope**: assert the union of all `acceptance` items and all
  `verify` entries across the consolidated array equals the union across the
  draft. Nothing is dropped; nothing new is invented. If you cannot preserve an
  item, you have over-reached — back the operation out.

### Step 4 — Write both artifacts

Write the consolidated array to `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json` (2-space
indent, machine-consumed) and the rationale + before/after diff to
`temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/consolidation-report.md`. When the consolidated count
landed **below** the Delivery-Slicing ceiling, the report MUST call that out
explicitly — a `Below ceiling: N (Delivery Slicing) → M (consolidated)` line
plus a one-line rationale per below-ceiling merge (which dependent
single-consumer slice folded into which consumer, and why it was unjustified) —
so the operator sees the coarsening at the Phase 8.3 advisory diff.

### Step 5 — Hand back to `/plan`

Return control. The workflow shows the operator the consolidation report at the
HITL diff gate; on approval it runs
`node .agents/scripts/epic-plan-decompose.js --epic <Epic_ID> --tickets
temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json`, which validates the consolidated array,
persists the hierarchy, and flips the Epic to `agent::ready`.

## Constraints

- Do **not** call the GitHub API from this Skill. It reads two temp artifacts
  and writes two temp artifacts; persistence belongs to the script.
- Do **not** write outside `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/`.
- Do **not** add scope or invent tickets. The two permitted operations (merge
  Stories, rewire `depends_on`) are exhaustive — anything else is out of
  contract.
- If `temp/epic-<Epic_ID>/tickets.json` is missing, fail loudly and instruct
  the caller to run the `epic-plan-decompose-author` Skill first.
- The validator
  ([`lib/orchestration/ticket-validator.js`](../../../scripts/lib/orchestration/ticket-validator.js))
  is the authoritative post-consolidation gate. Re-consolidate when it
  rejects rather than patching tickets by hand.
